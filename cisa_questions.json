    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: The process of Auditing Information System\nThe Urgent Pointer is used when some information has to reach the server ASAP. When the TCP/IP stack at the other end sees a packet using the Urgent Pointer\nset, it is duty bound to stop all ongoing activities and immediately send this packet up the stack for immediate processing. Since the packet is plucked out of the\nprocessing queue and acted upon immediately, it is known as an Out Of Band (OOB)packet and the data is called Out Of Band (OOB) data.\n\nThe Urgent Pointer is usually used in Telnet, where an immediate response (e.g. the echoing of characters) is desirable.\n\nCovert Channels are not directly synonymous with backdoors. A covert channel is simply using a communication protocol in a way it was not intended to be used\nor sending data without going through the proper access control mechanisms or channels. For example, in a Mandatory Access Control systems a user at secret\nhas found a way to communicate information to a user at Confidential without going through the normal channels.\n\nIn this case the Urgent bit could be used for a few reasons:\n\n1. It could be to attempt a Denial of service where the host receiving a packet with the Urgent bit set will give immediate attention to the request and will be in wait\nstate until the urgent message is receive, if the sender does not send the urgent message then it will simply sit there doing nothing until it times out. Some of the\nTCP/ IP stacks used to have a 600 seconds time out, which means that for 10 minutes nobody could use the port. By sending thousands of packet with the\nURGENT flag set, it would create a very effective denial of service attack.\n\n2. It could be used as a client server application to transmit data back and forward without going through the proper channels. It would be slow but it is possible to\nuse reserved fields and bits to transmit data outside the normal communication channels.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect\nhttp://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/rainbow/tg030.htm document covering the subject of covert channels and also see:\nhttp://gray-world.net/papers.shtml which is a large collection of documents on Covert Channels",

A risk assessment is carried out, and the results are analyzed. Risk analysis is used to ensure that security is cost-effective,\nrelevant, timely, and responsive to threats. Security can be quite complex, even for well-versed security professionals, and it is easy to apply too much security,\nnot enough security, or the wrong security controls, and to spend too much money in the process without attaining the necessary objectives. Risk analysis helps\n\fcompanies prioritize their risks and shows management the amount of resources that should be applied to protecting against those risks in a sensible manner.\n\nA risk analysis has four main goals:\nIdentify assets and their value to the organization.\nIdentify vulnerabilities and threats.\nQuantify the probability and business impact of these potential threats. Provide an economic balance between the impact of the threat and the cost of the\ncountermeasure.\n\nTreating Risk\n\nRisk Mitigation\nRisk mitigation is the practice of the elimination of, or the significant decrease in the level of risk presented. Examples of risk mitigation can be seen in everyday\nlife and are readily apparent in the information technology world. Risk Mitigation involves applying appropriate control to reduce risk. For example, to lessen the\nrisk of exposing personal and financial information that is highly sensitive and confidential organizations put countermeasures in place, such as firewalls, intrusion\ndetection/prevention systems, and other mechanisms, to deter malicious outsiders from accessing this highly sensitive information. In the underage driver\nexample, risk mitigation could take the form of driver education for the youth or establishing a policy not allowing the young driver to use a cell phone while driving,\nor not letting youth of a certain age have more than one friend in the car as a passenger at any given time.\n\nRisk Transfer\nRisk transfer is the practice of passing on the risk in question to another entity, such as an insurance company. Let us look at one of the examples that were\npresented above in a different way. The family is evaluating whether to permit an underage driver to use the family car. The family decides that it is important for\nthe youth to be mobile, so it transfers the financial risk of a youth being in an accident to the insurance company, which provides the family with auto insurance.\nIt is important to note that the transfer of risk may be accompanied by a cost. This is certainly true for the insurance example presented earlier, and can be seen in\nother insurance instances, such as liability insurance for a vendor or the insurance taken out by companies to protect against hardware and software theft or\ndestruction. This may also be true if an organization must purchase and implement security controls in order to make their organization less desirable to attack. It\nis important to remember that not all risk can be transferred. While financial risk is simple to transfer through insurance, reputational risk may almost never be fully\n\ntransferred.\n\nRisk Avoidance\nRisk avoidance is the practice of coming up with alternatives so that the risk in question is not realized. For example, have you ever heard a friend, or parents of a\nfriend, complain about the costs of insuring an underage driver? How about the risks that many of these children face as they become mobile? Some of these\nfamilies will decide that the child in question will not be allowed to drive the family car, but will rather wait until he or she is of legal age (i.e., 18 years of age) before\ncommitting to owning, insuring, and driving a motor vehicle.\nIn this case, the family has chosen to avoid the risks (and any associated benefits) associated with an underage driver, such as poor driving performance or the\ncost of insurance for the child. Although this choice may be available for some situations, it is not available for all. Imagine a global retailer who, knowing the risks\nassociated with doing business on the Internet, decides to avoid the practice. This decision will likely cost the company a significant amount of its revenue (if,\nindeed, the company has products or services that consumers wish to purchase). In addition, the decision may require the company to build or lease a site in each\nof the locations, globally, for which it wishes to continue business. This could have a catastrophic effect on the company's ability to continue business operations\n\nRisk Acceptance\nIn some cases, it may be prudent for an organization to simply accept the risk that is presented in certain scenarios. Risk acceptance is the practice of accepting\ncertain risk(s), typically based on a business decision that may also weigh the cost versus the benefit of dealing with the risk in another way. For example, an\nexecutive may be confronted with risks identified during the course of a risk assessment for their organization. These risks have been prioritized by high, medium,\nand low impact to the organization. The executive notes that in order to mitigate or transfer the low-level risks, significant costs could be involved. Mitigation might\ninvolve the hiring of additional highly skilled personnel and the purchase of new hardware, software, and office equipment, while transference of the risk to an\ninsurance company would require premium payments. The\nexecutive then further notes that minimal impact to the organization would occur if any of the reported low-level threats were realized. Therefore, he or she (rightly)\nconcludes that it is wiser for the organization to forgo the costs and accept the risk. In the young driver example, risk acceptance could be based on the\nobservation that the youngster has demonstrated the responsibility and maturity to warrant the parent's trust in his or her judgment.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nRisk Transfer - Risk transfer is the practice of passing on the risk in question to another entity, such as an insurance company.

For example, to lessen the\nrisk of exposing personal and financial information that is highly sensitive and confidential organizations put countermeasures in place, such as firewalls, intrusion\ndetection/prevention systems, and other mechanisms, to deter malicious outsiders from accessing this highly sensitive information. In the underage driver\nexample, risk mitigation could take the form of driver education for the youth or establishing a policy not allowing the young driver to use a cell phone while driving,\n\for not letting youth of a certain age have more than one friend in the car as a passenger at any given time.\n\nRisk Transfer\nRisk transfer is the practice of passing on the risk in question to another entity, such as an insurance company. Let us look at one of the examples that were\npresented above in a different way. The family is evaluating whether to permit an underage driver to use the family car. The family decides that it is important for\nthe youth to be mobile, so it transfers the financial risk of a youth being in an accident to the insurance company, which provides the family with auto insurance.\nIt is important to note that the transfer of risk may be accompanied by a cost. This is certainly true for the insurance example presented earlier, and can be seen in\nother insurance instances, such as liability insurance for a vendor or the insurance taken out by companies to protect against hardware and software theft or\ndestruction. This may also be true if an organization must purchase and implement security controls in order to make their organization less desirable to attack. It\nis important to remember that not all risk can be transferred. While financial risk is simple to transfer through insurance, reputational risk may almost never be fully\ntransferred.\n\nRisk Avoidance\nRisk avoidance is the practice of coming up with alternatives so that the risk in question is not realized. For example, have you ever heard a friend, or parents of a\nfriend, complain about the costs of insuring an underage driver? How about the risks that many of these children face as they become mobile? Some of these\n\nfamilies will decide that the child in question will not be allowed to drive the family car, but will rather wait until he or she is of legal age (i.e., 18 years of age) before\ncommitting to owning, insuring, and driving a motor vehicle.\nIn this case, the family has chosen to avoid the risks (and any associated benefits) associated with an underage driver, such as poor driving performance or the\ncost of insurance for the child. Although this choice may be available for some situations, it is not available for all. Imagine a global retailer who, knowing the risks\nassociated with doing business on the Internet, decides to avoid the practice. This decision will likely cost the company a significant amount of its revenue (if,\nindeed, the company has products or services that consumers wish to purchase). In addition, the decision may require the company to build or lease a site in each\nof the locations, globally, for which it wishes to continue business. This could have a catastrophic effect on the company's ability to continue business operations\n\nRisk Acceptance\nIn some cases, it may be prudent for an organization to simply accept the risk that is presented in certain scenarios. Risk acceptance is the practice of accepting\ncertain risk(s), typically based on a business decision that may also weigh the cost versus the benefit of dealing with the risk in another way. For example, an\nexecutive may be confronted with risks identified during the course of a risk assessment for their organization. These risks have been prioritized by high, medium,\nand low impact to the organization. The executive notes that in order to mitigate or transfer the low-level risks, significant costs could be involved. Mitigation might\ninvolve the hiring of additional highly skilled personnel and the purchase of new hardware, software, and office equipment, while transference of the risk to an\ninsurance company would require premium payments. The\nexecutive then further notes that minimal impact to the organization would occur if any of the reported low-level threats were realized. Therefore, he or she (rightly)\nconcludes that it is wiser for the organization to forgo the costs and accept the risk. In the young driver example, risk acceptance could be based on the\nobservation that the youngster has demonstrated the responsibility and maturity to warrant the parent's trust in his or her judgment.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nRisk Transfer - Risk transfer is the practice of passing on the risk in question to another entity, such as an insurance company. Let us look at one of the examples\nthat were presented above in a different way.\n\nRisk Acceptance - Risk acceptance is the practice of accepting certain risk(s), typically based on a business decision that may also weigh the cost versus the\nbenefit of dealing with the risk in another way.\n\nRisk Mitigation -Risk mitigation is the practice of the elimination of, or the significant decrease in the level of risk presented\nCISA Review Manual 2014 Page number 51\nand\nOfficial ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd edition page number 534-536",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: The process of Auditing Information System\nDeterrent Control are intended to discourage a potential attacker\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about different security controls\n\nDeterrent Controls\nDeterrent Controls are intended to discourage a potential attacker. Access controls act as a deterrent to threats and attacks by the simple fact that the existence of\nthe control is enough to keep some potential attackers from attempting to circumvent the control. This is often because the effort required to circumvent the control\nis far greater than the potential reward if the attacker is successful, or, conversely, the negative implications of a failed attack (or getting caught) outweigh the\nbenefits of success. For example, by forcing the identification and authentication of a user, service, or application, and all that it implies, the potential for incidents\nassociated with the system is significantly reduced because an attacker will fear association with the incident. If there are no controls for a given access path, the\nnumber of incidents and the potential impact become infinite. Controls inherently reduce exposure to risk by applying oversight for a process. This oversight acts\nas a deterrent, curbing an attacker's appetite in the face of probable repercussions.\n\nThe best example of a deterrent control is demonstrated by employees and their propensity to intentionally perform unauthorized functions, leading to unwanted\nevents.\n\nWhen users begin to understand that by authenticating into a system to perform a function, their activities are logged and monitored, and it reduces the likelihood\nthey will attempt such an action. Many threats are based on the anonymity of the threat agent, and any potential for identification and association with their actions\nis avoided at all costs.\n\nIt is this fundamental reason why access controls are the key target of circumvention by attackers. Deterrents also take the form of potential punishment if users\ndo something unauthorized. For example, if the organization policy specifies that an employee installing an unauthorized wireless access point will be fired, that\nwill determine most employees from installing wireless access points.\n\nPreventative Controls\nPreventive controls are intended to avoid an incident from occurring. Preventative access controls keep a user from performing some activity or function.\nPreventative controls differ from deterrent controls in that the control is not optional and cannot (easily) be bypassed. Deterrent controls work on the theory that it\nis easier to obey the control\nrather than to risk the consequences of bypassing the control. In other words, the power for action resides with the user (or the attacker). Preventative controls\nplace the power of action with the system, obeying the control is not optional. The only way to bypass the control is to find a flaw in the control's implementation.\n\nCompensating Controls\nCompensating controls are introduced when the existing capabilities of a system do not support the requirement of a policy. Compensating controls can be\n\ftechnical, procedural, or managerial. Although an existing system may not support the required controls, there may exist other technology or processes that can\nsupplement the existing environment, closing the gap in controls, meeting policy requirements, and reducing overall risk.\n\nFor example, the access control policy may state that the authentication process must be encrypted when performed over the Internet. Adjusting an application to\nnatively support encryption for authentication purposes may be too costly. Secure Socket Layer (SSL), an encryption protocol, can be employed and layered on\ntop of the authentication process to support the policy statement.\n\nOther examples include a separation of duties environment, which offers the capability to isolate certain tasks to compensate for technical limitations in the system\nand ensure the security of transactions. In addition, management processes, such as authorization, supervision, and administration, can be used to compensate\nfor gaps in the access control environment.\n\nDetective Controls\nDetective controls warn when something has happened, and are the earliest point in the post-incident timeline.\n\nAccess controls are a deterrent to threats and can be aggressively utilized to prevent harmful incidents through the application of least privilege. However, the\ndetective nature of access controls can provide significant visibility into the access environment and help organizations manage their access strategy and related\nsecurity risk.\n\nAs mentioned previously, strongly managed access privileges provided to an authenticated user offer the ability to reduce the risk exposure of the enterprise's\nassets by limiting the capabilities that authenticated user has. However, there are few options to control what a user can perform once privileges are provided. For\nexample, if a user is provided write access to a file and that file is damaged, altered, or otherwise negatively impacted (either deliberately or unintentionally), the\nuse of applied access controls will offer visibility into the transaction. The control environment can be established to log activity regarding the identification,\nauthentication, authorization, and use of privileges on a system.\n\nThis can be used to detect the occurrence of errors, the attempts to perform an unauthorized action, or to validate when provided credentials were exercised. The\nlogging system as a detective device provides evidence of actions (both successful and unsuccessful) and tasks that were executed by authorized users.\n\nCorrective Controls\nWhen a security incident occurs, elements within the security infrastructure may require corrective actions. Corrective controls are actions that seek to alter the\nsecurity posture of an environment to correct any deficiencies and return the environment to a secure state. A security incident signals the failure of one or more\ndirective, deterrent, preventative, or compensating controls. The detective controls may have triggered an alarm or notification, but now the corrective controls\nmust work to stop the incident in its tracks. Corrective controls can take many forms, all depending on the particular situation at hand or the particular security\nfailure that needs to be dealt with.\n\nRecovery Controls\nAny changes to the access control environment, whether in the face of a security incident or to offer temporary compensating controls, need to be accurately\nreinstated and returned to normal operations. There are several situations that may affect access controls, their applicability, status, or management.\n\nEvents can include system outages, attacks, project changes, technical demands, administrative gaps, and full-blown disaster situations. For example, if an\napplication is not correctly installed or deployed, it may adversely affect controls placed on system files or even have default administrative accounts unknowingly\nimplemented upon install.\n\nAdditionally, an employee may be transferred, quit, or be on temporary leave that may affect policy requirements regarding separation of duties. An attack on\nsystems may have resulted in the implantation of a Trojan horse program, potentially exposing private user information, such as credit card information and\nfinancial data. In all of these cases, an undesirable situation must be rectified as quickly as possible and controls returned to normal operations.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nPreventive - Preventive controls are intended to avoid an incident from occurring Corrective - Corrective control fixes components or systems after an incident has\noccurred Recovery - Recovery controls are intended to bring the environment back to regular operations CISA Review Manual 2014 Page number 44\nand\nOfficial ISC2 CISSP guide 3rd edition Page number 50 and 51",

Corrective controls are actions that seek to alter the\nsecurity posture of an environment to correct any deficiencies and return the environment to a secure state.

Access controls act as a deterrent to threats and attacks by the simple fact that the existence of\nthe control is enough to keep some potential attackers from attempting to circumvent the control. This is often because the effort required to circumvent the control\nis far greater than the potential reward if the attacker is successful, or, conversely, the negative implications of a failed attack (or getting caught) outweigh the\nbenefits of success. For example, by forcing the identification and authentication of a user, service, or application, and all that it implies, the potential for incidents\nassociated with the system is significantly reduced because an attacker will fear association with the incident. If there are no controls for a given access path, the\nnumber of incidents and the potential impact become infinite. Controls inherently reduce exposure to risk by applying oversight for a process. This oversight acts\nas a deterrent, curbing an attacker's appetite in the face of probable repercussions.\n\nThe best example of a deterrent control is demonstrated by employees and their propensity to intentionally perform unauthorized functions, leading to unwanted\nevents.\n\nWhen users begin to understand that by authenticating into a system to perform a function, their activities are logged and monitored, and it reduces the likelihood\nthey will attempt such an action. Many threats are based on the anonymity of the threat agent, and any potential for identification and association with their actions\nis avoided at all costs.\n\fIt is this fundamental reason why access controls are the key target of circumvention by attackers. Deterrents also take the form of potential punishment if users\ndo something unauthorized. For example, if the organization policy specifies that an employee installing an unauthorized wireless access point will be fired, that\nwill\n\ndetermine most employees from installing wireless access points.\n\nPreventative Controls\nPreventive controls are intended to avoid an incident from occurring. Preventative access controls keep a user from performing some activity or function.\nPreventative controls differ from deterrent controls in that the control is not optional and cannot (easily) be bypassed. Deterrent controls work on the theory that it\nis easier to obey the control\nrather than to risk the consequences of bypassing the control. In other words, the power for action resides with the user (or the attacker). Preventative controls\nplace the power of action with the system, obeying the control is not optional. The only way to bypass the control is to find a flaw in the control's implementation.\n\nCompensating Controls\nCompensating controls are introduced when the existing capabilities of a system do not support the requirement of a policy. Compensating controls can be\ntechnical, procedural, or managerial. Although an existing system may not support the required controls, there may exist other technology or processes that can\nsupplement the existing environment, closing the gap in controls, meeting policy requirements, and reducing overall risk.\n\nFor example, the access control policy may state that the authentication process must be encrypted when performed over the Internet. Adjusting an application to\nnatively support encryption for authentication purposes may be too costly. Secure Socket Layer (SSL), an encryption protocol, can be employed and layered on\ntop of the authentication process to support the policy statement.\nOther examples include a separation of duties environment, which offers the capability to isolate certain tasks to compensate for technical limitations in the system\nand ensure the security of transactions.

Corrective controls can take\nmany forms, all depending on the particular situation at hand or the particular security failure that needs to be dealt with.\n\nRecovery Controls\nAny changes to the access control environment, whether in the face of a security incident or to offer temporary compensating controls, need to be accurately\nreinstated and returned to normal operations. There are several situations that may affect access controls, their applicability, status, or management. Events can\ninclude system outages, attacks, project changes, technical demands, administrative gaps, and full-blown disaster situations. For example, if an application is not\ncorrectly installed or deployed, it may adversely affect controls placed on system files or even have default administrative accounts unknowingly implemented\nupon install. Additionally, an employee may be transferred, quit, or be on temporary leave that may affect policy requirements regarding separation of duties. An\nattack on systems may have resulted in the implantation of a Trojan horse program, potentially exposing private user information, such as credit card information\nand financial data. In all of these cases, an undesirable situation must be rectified as quickly as possible and controls returned to normal operations.\nFor your exam you should know below information about different security controls\n\nDeterrent Controls\nDeterrent Controls are intended to discourage a potential attacker. Access controls act as a deterrent to threats and attacks by the simple fact that the existence of\nthe control is enough to keep some potential attackers from attempting to circumvent the control. This is often because the effort required to circumvent the control\nis far greater than the potential reward if the attacker is successful, or, conversely, the negative implications of a failed attack (or getting caught) outweigh the\nbenefits of success. For example, by forcing the identification and authentication of a user, service, or application, and all that it implies, the potential for incidents\nassociated with the system is significantly reduced because an attacker will fear association with the incident. If there are no controls for a given access path, the\nnumber of incidents and the potential impact become infinite. Controls inherently reduce exposure to risk by applying oversight for a process. This oversight acts\nas a deterrent, curbing an attacker's appetite in the face of probable repercussions.\n\nThe best example of a deterrent control is demonstrated by employees and their propensity to intentionally perform unauthorized functions, leading to unwanted\nevents.\n\nWhen users begin to understand that by authenticating into a system to perform a function, their activities are logged and monitored, and it reduces the likelihood\nthey will attempt such an action. Many threats are based on the anonymity of the threat agent, and any potential for identification and association with their actions\nis avoided at all costs.\n\nIt is this fundamental reason why access controls are the key target of circumvention by attackers. Deterrents also take the form of potential punishment if users\ndo something unauthorized. For example, if the organization policy specifies that an employee installing an unauthorized wireless access point will be fired, that\nwill determine most employees from installing wireless access points.\n\nPreventative Controls\nPreventive controls are intended to avoid an incident from occurring. Preventative access controls keep a user from performing some activity or function.\nPreventative controls differ from deterrent controls in that the control is not optional and cannot (easily) be bypassed. Deterrent controls work on the theory that it\nis easier to obey the control\nrather than to risk the consequences of bypassing the control. In other words, the power for action resides with the user (or the attacker). Preventative controls\nplace the power of action with the system, obeying the control is not optional. The only way to bypass the control is to find a flaw in the control's implementation.\n\nCompensating Controls\n\nCompensating controls are introduced when the existing capabilities of a system do not support the requirement of a policy. Compensating controls can be\ntechnical, procedural, or managerial. Although an existing system may not support the required controls, there may exist other technology or processes that can\nsupplement the existing environment, closing the gap in controls, meeting policy requirements, and reducing overall risk.\n\nFor example, the access control policy may state that the authentication process must be encrypted when performed over the Internet. Adjusting an application to\nnatively support encryption for authentication purposes may be too costly. Secure Socket Layer (SSL), an encryption protocol, can be employed and layered on\ntop of the authentication process to support the policy statement.\n\fOther examples include a separation of duties environment, which offers the capability to isolate certain tasks to compensate for technical limitations in the system\nand ensure the security of transactions. In addition, management processes, such as authorization, supervision, and administration, can be used to compensate\nfor gaps in the access control environment.\n\nDetective Controls\nDetective controls warn when something has happened, and are the earliest point in the post-incident timeline. Access controls are a deterrent to threats and can\nbe aggressively utilized to prevent harmful incidents through the application of least privilege. However, the detective nature of access controls can provide\nsignificant visibility into the access environment and help organizations manage their access strategy and related security risk.\nAs mentioned previously, strongly managed access privileges provided to an authenticated user offer the ability to reduce the risk exposure of the enterprise's\nassets by limiting the capabilities that authenticated user has. However, there are few options to control what a user can perform once privileges are provided. For\nexample, if a user is provided write access to a file and that file is damaged, altered, or otherwise negatively impacted (either deliberately or unintentionally), the\nuse of applied access controls will offer visibility into the transaction. The control environment can be established to log activity regarding the identification,\nauthentication, authorization, and use of privileges on a system.\n\nThis can be used to detect the occurrence of errors, the attempts to perform an unauthorized action, or to validate when provided credentials were exercised. The\nlogging system as a detective device provides evidence of actions (both successful and unsuccessful) and tasks that were executed by authorized users.\n\nCorrective Controls\nWhen a security incident occurs, elements within the security infrastructure may require corrective actions. Corrective controls are actions that seek to alter the\nsecurity posture of an environment to correct any deficiencies and return the environment to a secure state. A security incident signals the failure of one or more\ndirective, deterrent, preventative, or compensating controls. The detective controls may have triggered an alarm or notification, but now the corrective controls\nmust work to stop the incident in its tracks.

There are several situations that may affect access controls, their applicability, status, or management.\n\nEvents can include system outages, attacks, project changes, technical demands, administrative gaps, and full-blown disaster situations.

Events can\ninclude system outages, attacks, project changes, technical demands, administrative gaps, and full-blown disaster situations. For example, if an application is not\ncorrectly installed or deployed, it may adversely affect controls placed on system files or even have default administrative accounts unknowingly implemented\nupon install. Additionally, an employee may be transferred, quit, or be on temporary leave that may affect policy requirements regarding separation of duties. An\nattack on systems may have resulted in the implantation of a Trojan horse program, potentially exposing private user information, such as credit card information\nand financial data. In all of these cases, an undesirable situation must be rectified as quickly as possible and controls returned to normal operations.\n\fFor your exam you should know below information about different security controls\n\nDeterrent Controls\nDeterrent Controls are intended to discourage a potential attacker. Access controls act as a deterrent to threats and attacks by the simple fact that the existence of\nthe control is enough to keep some potential attackers from attempting to circumvent the control. This is often because the effort required to circumvent the control\nis far greater than the potential reward if the attacker is successful, or, conversely, the negative implications of a failed attack (or getting caught) outweigh the\nbenefits of success. For example, by forcing the identification and authentication of a user, service, or application, and all that it implies, the potential for incidents\nassociated with the system is significantly reduced because an attacker will fear association with the incident. If there are no controls for a given access path, the\nnumber of incidents and the potential impact become infinite. Controls inherently reduce exposure to risk by applying oversight for a process. This oversight acts\nas a deterrent, curbing an attacker's appetite in the face of probable repercussions.\n\nThe best example of a deterrent control is demonstrated by employees and their propensity to intentionally perform unauthorized functions, leading to unwanted\nevents.\n\nWhen users begin to understand that by authenticating into a system to perform a function, their activities are logged and monitored, and it reduces the likelihood\nthey will attempt such an action. Many threats are based on the anonymity of the threat agent, and any potential for identification and association with their actions\nis avoided at all costs.\n\nIt is this fundamental reason why access controls are the key target of circumvention by attackers. Deterrents also take the form of potential punishment if users\ndo something unauthorized. For example, if the organization\n\npolicy specifies that an employee installing an unauthorized wireless access point will be fired, that will determine most employees from installing wireless access\npoints.\n\nPreventative Controls\nPreventive controls are intended to avoid an incident from occurring. Preventative access controls keep a user from performing some activity or function.\nPreventative controls differ from deterrent controls in that the control is not optional and cannot (easily) be bypassed. Deterrent controls work on the theory that it\nis easier to obey the control\nrather than to risk the consequences of bypassing the control. In other words, the power for action resides with the user (or the attacker). Preventative controls\nplace the power of action with the system, obeying the control is not optional. The only way to bypass the control is to find a flaw in the control's implementation.\n\nCompensating Controls\nCompensating controls are introduced when the existing capabilities of a system do not support the requirement of a policy. Compensating controls can be\ntechnical, procedural, or managerial. Although an existing system may not support the required controls, there may exist other technology or processes that can\nsupplement the existing environment, closing the gap in controls, meeting policy requirements, and reducing overall risk.\n\nFor example, the access control policy may state that the authentication process must be encrypted when performed over the Internet. Adjusting an application to\nnatively support encryption for authentication purposes may be too costly. Secure Socket Layer (SSL), an encryption protocol, can be employed and layered on\ntop of the authentication process to support the policy statement.\n\nOther examples include a separation of duties environment, which offers the capability to isolate certain tasks to compensate for technical limitations in the system\nand ensure the security of transactions. In addition, management processes, such as authorization, supervision, and administration, can be used to compensate\nfor gaps in the access control environment.\n\nDetective Controls\nDetective controls warn when something has happened, and are the earliest point in the post-incident timeline. Access controls are a deterrent to threats and can\nbe aggressively utilized to prevent harmful incidents through the application of least privilege. However, the detective nature of access controls can provide\nsignificant visibility into the access environment and help organizations manage their access strategy and related security risk.\n\nAs mentioned previously, strongly managed access privileges provided to an authenticated user offer the ability to reduce the risk exposure of the enterprise's\nassets by limiting the capabilities that authenticated user has. However, there are few options to control what a user can perform once privileges are provided. For\nexample, if a user is provided write access to a file and that file is damaged, altered, or otherwise negatively impacted (either deliberately or unintentionally), the\nuse of applied access controls will offer visibility into the transaction. The control environment can be established to log activity regarding the identification,\nauthentication, authorization, and use of privileges on a system.\n\nThis can be used to detect the occurrence of errors, the attempts to perform an unauthorized action, or to validate when provided credentials were exercised. The\nlogging system as a detective device provides evidence of actions (both successful and unsuccessful) and tasks that were executed by authorized users.\n\nCorrective Controls\nWhen a security incident occurs, elements within the security infrastructure may require corrective actions. Corrective controls are actions that seek to alter the\nsecurity posture of an environment to correct any deficiencies and return the environment to a secure state. A security incident signals the failure of one or more\ndirective, deterrent, preventative, or compensating controls. The detective controls may have triggered an alarm or notification, but now the corrective controls\nmust work to stop the incident in its tracks. Corrective controls can take many forms, all depending on the particular situation at hand or the particular security\nfailure that needs to be dealt with.\n\nRecovery Controls\nAny changes to the access control environment, whether in the face of a security incident or to offer temporary\n\ncompensating controls, need to be accurately reinstated and returned to normal operations. There are several situations that may affect access controls, their\napplicability, status, or management.\n\nEvents can include system outages, attacks, project changes, technical demands, administrative gaps, and full-blown disaster situations. For example, if an\napplication is not correctly installed or deployed, it may adversely affect controls placed on system files or even have default administrative accounts unknowingly\nimplemented upon install.\n\nAdditionally, an employee may be transferred, quit, or be on temporary leave that may affect policy requirements regarding separation of duties. An attack on\nsystems may have resulted in the implantation of a Trojan horse program, potentially exposing private user information, such as credit card information and\nfinancial data. In all of these cases, an undesirable situation must be rectified as quickly as possible and controls returned to normal operations.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe other examples belong to corrective control.\nCISA Review Manual 2014 Page number 44\nand\nOfficial ISC2 CISSP guide 3rd edition Page number 50 and 51",

Independent accounting, security or IT consultants\nevaluate the strength and thoroughness of compliance preparations. Auditors review security polices, user access controls and risk management procedures over\nthe course of a compliance audit. Compliance audit include specific tests of controls to demonstrate adherence to specific regulatory or industry standard. These\naudits often overlap traditional audits, but may focus on particular system or data.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about different types of audit:\n\nWhat is an audit?\nAn audit in general terms is a process of evaluating an individual or organization's accounts. This is usually done by an independent auditing body. Thus, audit\ninvolves a competent and independent person obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively with regard to a given entity, which in this case is the subject of\naudit, in order to establish conformance to a given set of standards. Audit can be on a person, organization, system, enterprise, project or product.\n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit is a comprehensive review of an organization's adherence to regulatory guidelines.\n\nIndependent accounting, security or IT consultants evaluate the strength and thoroughness of compliance preparations. Auditors review security polices, user\naccess controls and risk management procedures over the course of a compliance audit. Compliance audit include specific tests of controls to demonstrate\nadherence to specific regulatory or industry standard. These audits often overlap traditional audits, but may focus on particular system or data.\n\nWhat, precisely, is examined in a compliance audit will vary depending upon whether an organization is a public or private company, what kind of data it handles\nand if it transmits or stores sensitive financial data. For instance, SOX requirements mean that any electronic communication must be backed up and secured with\nreasonable disaster recovery infrastructure. Health care providers that store or transmit e-health records, like personal health information, are subject to HIPAA\nrequirements. Financial services companies that transmit credit card data are subject to PCI DSS requirements. In each case, the organization must be able to\ndemonstrate compliance by producing an audit trail, often generated by data from event log management software.\n\nFinancial Audit\nA financial audit, or more accurately, an audit of financial statements, is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity, with a view to express an audit\nopinion. The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework. The purpose of an audit is to provide an objective\nindependent examination of the financial statements, which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management, thus increase\nuser confidence in the financial statement, reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements.\n\nOperational Audit\nOperational Audit is a systematic review of effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operation. Operational audit is a future-oriented, systematic, and independent\nevaluation of organizational activities. In Operational audit financial data may be used, but the primary sources of evidence are the operational policies and\nachievements related to organizational objectives. Operational audit is a more comprehensive form of an Internal audit.\n\nThe Institute of Internal Auditor (IIA) defines Operational Audit as a systematic process of evaluating an organization's effectiveness, efficiency and economy of\noperations under management's control and reporting to appropriate persons the results of the evaluation along with recommendations for improvement.\n\nObjectives\nTo appraise the effectiveness and efficiency of a division, activity, or operation of the entity in meeting organizational goals.\nTo understand the responsibilities and risks faced by an organization. To identify, with management participation, opportunities for improving control. To provide\nsenior management of the organization with a detailed understanding of the Operations.\n\nIntegrated Audits\nAn integrated audit combines financial and operational audit steps. An integrated audit is also performed to assess overall objectives within an organization,\nrelated to financial information and asset, safeguarding, efficiency and or internal auditors and would include compliance test of internal controls and substantive\naudit step.\n\nIS Audit\nAn information technology audit, or information systems audit, is an examination of the management controls within an Information technology (IT) infrastructure.\nThe evaluation of obtained evidence determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining data integrity, and operating effectively to achieve\nthe organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a financial statement audit, internal audit, or other form of attestation\nengagement.\n\nThe primary functions of an IT audit are to evaluate the systems that are in place to guard an organization's information. Specifically, information technology audits\nare used to evaluate the organization's ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense information to authorized parties. The IT audit aims to\nevaluate\n\nthe following:\n\nWill the organization's computer systems be available for the business at all times when required? (known as availability) Will the information in the systems be\ndisclosed only to authorized users? (known as security and confidentiality) Will the information provided by the system always be accurate, reliable, and timely?\n(measures the integrity) In this way, the audit hopes to assess the risk to the company's valuable asset (its information) and establish methods of minimizing those\nrisks.\n\nForensic Audit\nForensic audit is the activity that consists of gathering, verifying, processing, analyzing of and reporting on data in order to obtain facts and/or evidence - in a\npredefined context - in the area of legal/financial disputes and or irregularities (including fraud) and giving preventative advice.\n\nThe purpose of a forensic audit is to use accounting procedures to collect evidence for the prosecution or investigation of financial crimes such as theft or fraud.\nForensic audits may be conducted to determine if wrongdoing occurred, or to gather materials for the case against an alleged criminal.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nFinancial Audit- A financial audit, or more accurately, an audit of financial statements, is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity, with a view to\nexpress an audit opinion.

Operational audit is a future-oriented, systematic, and independent evaluation of organizational activities. In Operational audit\nfinancial data may be used, but the primary sources of evidence are the operational policies and achievements related to organizational objectives. Operational\naudit is a more comprehensive form of an Internal audit.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about different types of audit:\n\nWhat is an audit?\nAn audit in general terms is a process of evaluating an individual or organization's accounts. This is usually done by an independent auditing body. Thus, audit\ninvolves a competent and independent person obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively with regard to a given entity, which in this case is the subject of\naudit, in order to establish conformance to a given set of standards. Audit can be on a person, organization, system, enterprise, project or product.\n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit is a comprehensive review of an organization's adherence to regulatory guidelines. Independent accounting, security or IT consultants\nevaluate the strength and thoroughness of compliance preparations. Auditors review security polices, user access controls and risk management procedures over\nthe course of a compliance audit. Compliance audit include specific tests of controls to demonstrate adherence to specific regulatory or industry standard. These\naudits often overlap traditional audits, but may focus on particular system or data.\n\nWhat, precisely, is examined in a compliance audit will vary depending upon whether an organization is a public or private company, what kind of data it handles\nand if it transmits or stores sensitive financial data. For instance, SOX requirements mean that any electronic communication must be backed up and secured with\nreasonable disaster recovery infrastructure. Health care providers that store or transmit e-health records, like personal health information, are subject to HIPAA\nrequirements. Financial services companies that transmit credit card data are subject to PCI DSS requirements. In each case, the organization must be able to\ndemonstrate compliance by producing an audit trail, often generated by data from event log management software.\n\nFinancial Audit\nA financial audit, or more accurately, an audit of financial statements, is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity, with a view to express an audit\nopinion. The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework. The purpose of an audit is to provide an objective\nindependent examination of the financial statements, which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management, thus increase\nuser confidence in the financial statement, reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements.\n\nOperational Audit\nOperational Audit is a systematic review of effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operation. Operational audit is a future-oriented, systematic, and independent\nevaluation of organizational activities.

To identify, with management participation, opportunities for improving control. To provide\nsenior management of the organization with a detailed understanding of the Operations.\n\nIntegrated Audits\nAn integrated audit combines financial and operational audit steps. An integrated audit is also performed to assess overall objectives within an organization,\nrelated to financial information and asset, safeguarding, efficiency and or internal auditors and would include compliance test of internal controls and substantive\naudit step.\n\nIS Audit\nAn information technology audit, or information systems audit, is an examination of the management controls within an Information technology (IT) infrastructure.\nThe evaluation of obtained evidence determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining data integrity, and operating effectively to achieve\nthe organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a financial statement audit, internal audit, or other form of attestation\nengagement.\n\nThe primary functions of an IT audit are to evaluate the systems that are in place to guard an organization's information. Specifically, information technology audits\nare used to evaluate the organization's ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense information to authorized parties. The IT audit aims to\nevaluate the following:\n\nWill the organization's computer systems be available for the business at all times when required? (known as availability) Will the information in the systems be\ndisclosed only to authorized users? (known as security and confidentiality) Will the information provided by the system always be accurate, reliable, and timely?\n(measures the integrity) In this way, the audit hopes to assess the risk to the company's valuable asset (its information) and establish methods of minimizing those\nrisks.\n\nForensic Audit\nForensic audit is the activity that consists of gathering, verifying, processing, analyzing of and reporting on data in order to obtain facts and/or evidence - in a\npredefined context - in the area of legal/financial disputes and or irregularities (including fraud) and giving preventative advice.\n\nThe purpose of a forensic audit is to use accounting procedures to collect evidence for the prosecution or\n\finvestigation of financial crimes such as theft or fraud. Forensic audits may be conducted to determine if wrongdoing occurred, or to gather materials for the case\nagainst an alleged criminal.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nCompliance Audit - A compliance audit is a comprehensive review of an organization's adherence to regulatory guidelines.

This risk is composed of inherent risk (IR), control risk (CR) and detection risk (DR), and can be calculated thus:\n\nAR = IR × CR × DR\n\nInherent Risk\n\nAuditors must determine risks when working with clients. One type of risk to be aware of is inherent risk. While assessing this level of risk, you ignore whether the\nclient has internal controls in place (such as a secondary review of financial statements) in order to help mitigate the inherent risk. You consider the strength of the\ninternal controls when assessing the client's control risk. Your job when assessing inherent risk is to evaluate how susceptible the financial statement assertions\nare to material misstatement given the nature of the client's\n\nbusiness. A few key factors can increase inherent risk.\n\nEnvironment and external factors: Here are some examples of environment and external factors that can lead to high inherent risk:\n\nRapid change: A business whose inventory becomes obsolete quickly experiences high inherent risk. Expiring patents: Any business in the pharmaceutical\nindustry also has inherently risky environment and external factors. Drug patents eventually expire, which means the company faces competition from other\nmanufacturers marketing the same drug under a generic label.\nState of the economy: The general level of economic growth is another external factor affecting all businesses. Availability of financing: Another external factor is\ninterest rates and the associated availability of financing. If your client is having problems meeting its short-term cash payments, available loans with low interest\nrates may mean the difference between your client staying in business or having to close its doors. Prior-period misstatements: If a company has made mistakes\n\fin prior years that weren't material (meaning they weren't significant enough to have to change), those errors still exist in the financial statements. You have to\naggregate prior-period misstatements with current year misstatements to see if you need to ask the client to adjust the account for the total misstatement.\n\nYou may think an understatement in one year compensates for an overstatement in another year. In auditing, this assumption isn't true. Say you work a cash\nregister and one night the register comes up $20 short. The next week, you somehow came up $20 over my draw count. The $20 differences are added together\nto represent the total amount of your mistakes which is $40 and not zero. Zero would indicate no mistakes at all had occurred.\n\nSusceptibility to theft or fraud: If a certain asset is susceptible to theft or fraud, the account or balance level may be considered inherently risky. For example, if a\nclient has a lot of customers who pay in cash, the balance sheet cash account is going to have risk associated with theft or fraud because of the fact that cash is\nmore easily diverted than customer checks or credit card payments.\n\nLooking at industry statistics relating to inventory theft, you may also decide to consider the inventory account as inherently risky. Small inventory items can further\nincrease the risk of this account valuation being incorrect because those items are easier to conceal (and therefore easier to steal).\n\nControl Risk\nControl risk has been defined under International Standards of Auditing (ISAs) as following:\n\nThe risk that a misstatement that could occur in an assertion about a class of transaction, account balance or disclosure and that could be material, either\nindividually or when aggregated with other misstatements, will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis by the entity's internal control.\n\nIn simple words control risk is the probability that a material misstatement exists in an assertion because that misstatement was not either prevented from entering\nentity's financial information or it was not detected and corrected by the internal control system of the entity.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the management and those charged with governance to implement internal control system and maintain it appropriately which includes\nmanaging control risk.\n\nThere can be many reasons for control risk to arise and why it cannot be eliminated absolutely. But some of them are as follows:\n\nCost-benefit constraints\nCircumvention of controls\nInappropriate design of controls\nInappropriate application of controls\nLack of control environment and accountability\nNovel situations\nOutdated controls\nInappropriate segregation of duties\n\nDetection Risk\nDetection Risk is the risk that the auditors fail to detect a material misstatement in the financial statements. An auditor must apply audit procedures to detect\nmaterial misstatements in the financial statements whether due to fraud or error. Misapplication or omission of critical audit procedures may result in a material\nmisstatement remaining undetected by the auditor. Some detection risk is always present due to the inherent limitations of the audit such as the use of sampling\nfor the selection of transactions. Detection risk can be reduced by auditors by increasing the number of sampled transactions for detailed testing.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nControl Risk - The risk that material error exist that would not be prevented or detected on timely basis by the system of internal controls.\n\nDetection risk - The risk that material errors or misstatements that have occurred will not be detected by an IS auditor.\nOverall audit risk - The probability that information or financial report may contain material errors and that the auditor may not detect an error that has occurred. An\nobjective in formulating the audit approach is to limit the audit risk in the area under security so the overall audit risk is at sufficiently low level at the completion of\nthe examination.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 50\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_risk\nhttp://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-assess-inherent-risk-in-an-audit.html http://pakaccountants.com/what-is-control-risk/\nhttp://accounting-simplified.com/audit/risk-assessment/audit-risk.html",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Acquisition, Development and Implementation A gateway is used to connect two networks using dissimilar protocols at the lower\nlayers or it could also be at the highest level of the protocol stack.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nFor the purpose of the exam, you have to remember that a gateway is not synonymous to the term firewall.\n\nThe second thing you must remembers is the fact that a gateway act as a translation device. It could be used to translate from IPX to TCP/IP for example. It could\nbe used to convert different types of applications protocols and allow them to communicate together. A gateway could be at any of the OSI layers but usually tend\nto be higher up in the stack.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nRepeaters\nA repeater provides the simplest type of connectivity, because it only repeats electrical signals between cable segments, which enables it to extend a network.\nRepeaters work at the physical layer and are add-on devices for extending a network connection over a greater distance. The device amplifies signals because\nsignals attenuate the farther they have to travel.\nRepeaters can also work as line conditioners by actually cleaning up the signals. This works much better when amplifying digital signals than when amplifying\nanalog signals, because digital signals are discrete units, which makes extraction of background noise from them much easier for the amplifier. If the device is\namplifying analog signals, any accompanying noise often is amplified as well, which may further distort the signal. A hub is a multi-port repeater. A hub is often\nreferred to as a concentrator because it is the physical communication device that allows several computers and devices to communicate with each other. A hub\ndoes not understand or work with IP or MAC addresses. When one system sends a signal to go to another system connected to it, the signal is broadcast to all the\nports, and thus to all the systems connected to the concentrator.\n\fRepeater\n\n\n\n\nBridges\nA bridge is a LAN device used to connect LAN segments. It works at the data link layer and therefore works with MAC addresses. A repeater does not work with\naddresses; it just forwards all signals it receives. When a frame arrives at a bridge, the bridge determines whether or not the MAC address is on the local network\nsegment. If the MAC address is not on the local network segment, the bridge forwards the frame to the necessary network segment.\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\nRouters\nRouters are layer 3, or network layer, devices that are used to connect similar or different networks. (For example, they can connect two Ethernet LANs or an\nEthernet LAN to a Token Ring LAN.) A router is a device that has two or more interfaces and a routing table so it knows how to get packets to their destinations. It\ncan filter traffic based on access control lists (ACLs), and it fragments packets when necessary. Because routers have more network-level knowledge, they can\nperform higher-level functions, such as calculating the shortest and most economical path between the sending and receiving hosts.\n\nRouter and Switch\n\fSwitches\nSwitches combine the functionality of a repeater and the functionality of a bridge. A switch amplifies the electrical signal, like a repeater, and has the built-in\ncircuitry and intelligence of a bridge. It is a multi-port connection device that provides connections for individual computers or other hubs and switches.\n\nGateways\nGateway is a general term for software running on a device that connects two different environments and that many times acts as a translator for them or\nsomehow restricts their interactions. Usually a gateway is needed when one environment speaks a different language, meaning it uses a certain protocol that the\nother environment does not understand. The gateway can translate Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol packets to IP packets, accept mail from one type\nof mail server and format it so another type of mail server can accept and understand it, or connect and translate different data link technologies such as FDDI to\nEthernet.\n\nGateway Server\n\fThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nRepeater - A repeater provides the simplest type of connectivity, because it only repeats electrical signals between cable segments, which enables it to extend a\nnetwork. Repeaters work at the physical layer and are add-on devices for extending a network connection over a greater distance.

It is used mostly for short distance and supports voice and data.\nCopper has been used in electric wiring since the invention of the electromagnet and the telegraph in the 1820s.The invention of the telephone in 1876 created\nfurther demand for copper wire as an electrical\n\nconductor.\nCopper is the electrical conductor in many categories of electrical wiring. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution,\ntelecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Copper and its alloys are also used to make electrical contacts. Electrical\nwiring in buildings is the most important market for the copper industry. Roughly half of all copper mined is used to manufacture electrical wire and cable\nconductors.\nCopper Cable\n\fCoaxial cable\nCoaxial cable, or coax (pronounced 'ko.aks), is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular\nconducting shield. Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield\nsharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.Coaxial cable\ndiffers from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, such as audio signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a\nprecise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a radio frequency transmission line.\n\nCoaxial cable is expensive and does not support many LAN's. It supports data and video Coaxial Cable\n\fFiber optics\nAn optical fiber cable is a cable containing one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light. The optical fiber elements are typically individually coated with\nplastic layers and contained in a protective tube suitable for the environment where the cable will be deployed. Different types of cable are used for different\napplications, for example long distance telecommunication, or providing a high-speed data connection between different parts of a building.\n\nFiber optics used for long distance, hard to splice, not vulnerable to cross talk and difficult to tap. It supports voice data, image and video.\nRadio System\nRadio systems are used for short distance, cheap and easy to tap. Radio is the radiation (wireless transmission) of electromagnetic signals through the\natmosphere or free space.\n\nInformation, such as sound, is carried by systematically changing (modulating) some property of the radiated waves, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or\npulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can\nbe extracted and transformed back into its original form.\n\nFiber Optics\n\fMicrowave radio system\nMicrowave transmission refers to the technology of transmitting information or energy by the use of radio waves whose wavelengths are conveniently measured in\nsmall numbers of centimeter; these are called microwaves.\nMicrowaves are widely used for point-to-point communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow\nbeams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each\nother, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying\ncapacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of\nsight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\n\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep\nspace radio communications. Other parts of the microwave radio band are used for radars, radio navigation systems, sensor systems, and radio astronomy.\n\nMicrowave radio systems are carriers for voice data signal, cheap and easy to tap.\n\nMicrowave Radio System\n\fSatellite Radio Link\nSatellite radio is a radio service broadcast from satellites primarily to cars, with the signal broadcast nationwide, across a much wider geographical area than\nterrestrial radio stations. It is available by subscription, mostly commercial free, and offers subscribers more stations and a wider variety of programming\n\noptions than terrestrial radio.\n\nSatellite radio link uses transponder to send information and easy to tap.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nCopper Cable- Copper cable is very simple to install and easy to tap.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: The process of Auditing Information System\nCompliance, financial, operational, forensic and integrated are different types of audit.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nWhat is an audit?\nAn audit in general terms is a process of evaluating an individual or organization's accounts. This is usually done by an independent auditing body. Thus, audit\ninvolves a competent and independent person obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively with regard to a given entity, which in this case is the subject of\naudit, in order to establish conformance to a given set of standards. Audit can be on a person, organization, system, enterprise, project or product.\n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit is a comprehensive review of an organization's adherence to regulatory guidelines. Independent accounting, security or IT consultants\nevaluate the strength and thoroughness of compliance preparations. Auditors review security polices, user access controls and risk management procedures over\nthe course of a compliance audit. Compliance audit include specific tests of controls to demonstrate adherence to specific regulatory or industry standard. These\naudits often overlap traditional audits, but may focus on\n\nparticular system or data.\n\nWhat, precisely, is examined in a compliance audit will vary depending upon whether an organization is a public or private company, what kind of data it handles\nand if it transmits or stores sensitive financial data. For instance, SOX requirements mean that any electronic communication must be backed up and secured with\nreasonable disaster recovery infrastructure. Health care providers that store or transmit e-health records, like personal health information, are subject to HIPAA\nrequirements. Financial services companies that transmit credit card data are subject to PCI DSS requirements. In each case, the organization must be able to\ndemonstrate compliance by producing an audit trail, often generated by data from event log management software.\n\nFinancial Audit\nA financial audit, or more accurately, an audit of financial statements, is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity, with a view to express an audit\nopinion. The audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting framework. The purpose of an audit is to provide an objective\nindependent examination of the financial statements, which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management, thus increase\nuser confidence in the financial statement, reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statements.\n\nOperational Audit\nOperational Audit is a systematic review of effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operation. Operational audit is a future-oriented, systematic, and independent\nevaluation of organizational activities. In Operational audit financial data may be used, but the primary sources of evidence are the operational policies and\nachievements related to organizational objectives. Operational audit is a more comprehensive form of an Internal audit.\n\nThe Institute of Internal Auditor (IIA) defines Operational Audit as a systematic process of evaluating an organization's effectiveness, efficiency and economy of\noperations under management's control and reporting to appropriate persons the results of the evaluation along with recommendations for improvement.\n\nObjectives\nTo appraise the effectiveness and efficiency of a division, activity, or operation of the entity in meeting organizational goals.\nTo understand the responsibilities and risks faced by an organization. To identify, with management participation, opportunities for improving control. To provide\nsenior management of the organization with a detailed understanding of the Operations.\n\nIntegrated Audits\nAn integrated audit combines financial and operational audit steps. An integrated audit is also performed to assess overall objectives within an organization,\nrelated to financial information and asset, safeguarding, efficiency and or internal auditors and would include compliance test of internal controls and substantive\naudit step.\n\nIS Audit\nAn information technology audit, or information systems audit, is an examination of the management controls within an Information technology (IT) infrastructure.\nThe evaluation of obtained evidence determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining data integrity, and operating effectively to achieve\nthe organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a financial statement audit, internal audit, or other form of attestation\nengagement.\n\nThe primary functions of an IT audit are to evaluate the systems that are in place to guard an organization's information. Specifically, information technology audits\nare used to evaluate the organization's ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense information to authorized parties. The IT audit aims to\nevaluate the following:\n\nWill the organization's computer systems be available for the business at all times when required? (known as availability) Will the information in the systems be\ndisclosed only to authorized users? (known as security and\n\nconfidentiality) Will the information provided by the system always be accurate, reliable, and timely? (measures the integrity) In this way, the audit hopes to assess\nthe risk to the company's valuable asset (its information) and establish methods of minimizing those risks.\n\nForensic Audit\nForensic audit is the activity that consists of gathering, verifying, processing, analyzing of and reporting on data in order to obtain facts and/or evidence - in a\npredefined context - in the area of legal/financial disputes and or irregularities (including fraud) and giving preventative advice.\n\nThe purpose of a forensic audit is to use accounting procedures to collect evidence for the prosecution or investigation of financial crimes such as theft or fraud.\nForensic audits may be conducted to determine if wrongdoing occurred, or to gather materials for the case against an alleged criminal.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nCompliance, financial, operational, forensic and integrated are different types of audits. G9, SA1 and capability are not the audit types.\nCISA Review Manual 2014 Page number 47\nhttp://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/definition/compliance-audit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_audit\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_auditing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_audit\nhttp://www.investorwords.com/16445/forensic_audit.html",

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: The process of Auditing Information System\nThe NOT keyword is used in the question. You need find out an option which is NOT an example of statistical sampling. Statistical sampling is NOT based on\nHaphazard sampling.\nFor your exam you should know the information below\n\nAudit samples are selected for the purpose of collecting representative evidence to be subjected to either compliance testing or substantive testing. The auditor\nshould consider a selection technique that will provide the most relevant evidence supported by appropriate analytical procedures. Two basic types of audit\nsamples can be designed by the auditor to fulfill their requirements:\nstatistical and no statistical. Below Figure shows the various audit samples, as well as their testing methods. Care is given to the selection process in order to\navoid drawing the wrong conclusion from the wrong sample. This is referred to as a sampling risk. Let's look at each of these samples more closely.\n\nStatistical Sampling\nStatistical sampling uses mathematical techniques that result in an outcome that is mathematically quantifiable. Statistical samples are usually presented as a\npercentage. The purpose of statistical sampling is to gain an objective representation. Samples are selected by an objective mathematical process. The auditor\nshould be aware that if the client has strong internal controls, the sample sizes may be smaller because the\n\nodds of fraud or failure will be lower.\nExamples of statistical sampling include the following:\n\nRandom sampling Samples are selected at random.\nCell sampling Random selection is performed at predefined intervals. Fixed interval sampling The sample existing at every n + interval increment is selected for\ntesting.\n\nNo statistical Sampling\nNo statistical sampling is based on the auditor's judgment (also referred to as judgmental sampling). The auditor determines the sample size, the method of\ngenerating the sample, and the number of items to be analyzed. The results of judgmental sampling are unlikely to represent the actual population. This is a\nsubjective process usually based on elements of risk or materiality. An example of no statistical sampling includes haphazard sampling, in which the samples are\nrandomly drawn for testing. After the samples are selected, the next step is to perform compliance tests or substantive testing. Conducting Audit Testing As stated\nearlier, the basic test methods used will be either compliance testing or substantive testing. Appropriate audit samples will have to be generated for the test.\n\nCompliance Testing\nCompliance testing tests for the presence or absence of something. Compliance testing includes verifying that policies and procedures have been put in place,\nand checking that user access rights, program change control procedures, and system audit logs have been activated. An example of a compliance test is\ncomparing the list of persons with physical access to the data center against the HR list of current employees. Compliance testing is based on one of the following\ntypes of audit samples:\n\nAttribute sampling Generally popular in compliance testing. The objective is to determine whether an attribute is present or absent in the subject sample. The\nresult is specified by the rate of occurrence--for example, the presence of 1 in 100 units would be 1 percent.\nStop-and-go sampling Used when few errors are expected. Stop-and-go allows the test to occur without excessive effort in sampling and provides the opportunity\nto stop testing at the earliest possible opportunity. It is a simple form of testing to reinforce any claim that errors are unlikely in the sample population.\n\nDiscovery sampling A 100 percent sampling used to detect fraud or when the likelihood of evidence existing is low. Forensics is an excellent example of discovery\nsampling. This is an attempt to discover evidence. Precision, or expected error rate The precision rate indicates the acceptable margin of error between audit\nsamples and the total quantity of the subject population. This is usually expressed as a percentage, such as 5 percent. To obtain a very low error rate, it is\nnecessary to use a very large sample in testing. Auditors are justified in using a smaller sample size when the total population is expected to be error-free. A larger\nsample is required when errors are expected to be present in the population. The larger sample can yield a higher average. When errors are expected, the auditor\nmust examine more data to determine whether the actual errors are within a tolerable error rate (maximum errors you would accept). Error levels may be\ndetermined by reviewing the findings of a prior audit and by considering changes in the organization's procedures. Use the risk-based audit strategy to determine\nwhether your samples and tests are telling the truth about the audited.\n\nSubstantive Testing\nSubstantive testing seeks to verify the content and integrity of evidence. Substantive tests may include complex calculations to verify account balances, perform\nphysical inventory counts, or execute sample transactions to verify the accuracy of supporting documentation. Substantive tests use audit samples selected by\ndollar value or to project (forecast or estimate) a total for groups with related characteristics.\n\nSubstantive testing is based on one of the following types of audit samples:\n\nVariable sampling Used to designate dollar values or weights (effectiveness) of an entire subject population by prorating from a smaller sample. Consider the\nchallenge of counting large volumes of currency by its weight. Variable sampling could be used to count currency by multiplying the physical weight of one unit by\nthe total weight of the combined sample, and then multiplying by the face value printed on the bill or coin. A demonstration is a single $50 bill weighing 1.0 gram,\nwith the entire sample of $50 bills weighing 61 grams altogether. The combined sample weight would indicate a total quantity of 61 bills for an estimated dollar\nvalue\n\nof $3,050. This is a common technique for forecasting quantity and value of inventory based on particular characteristics.\nUnsatisfied mean estimation Used in an attempt to project an estimated total for the whole subject population. Stratified mean estimation Used to calculate an\naverage by group, similar to demographics, whereby the entire population is divided (stratified) into smaller groups based on similar characteristics. Examples are\nteenagers from the ages of 13 to 19, people from the ages of 20 to 29, people from the ages of 30 to 39, and those who are male or female, smokers or\nnonsmokers, and so on. Difference estimation Used to determine the difference between audited and unaudited claims of value.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nThe other options like Random Sampling, Cell Sampling and Fixed Interval Sampling are examples of Statistical sampling.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 55 to 56\nCISA certified information system auditor study guide Second Edition Page Number 98 to 101",

The problem is that it is impossible to plan and document actions for every possible\nscenario. Planning for just selected scenarios denies the fact that even improbable events can cause an organization to break down. Best practice planning\naddresses the four possible areas of impact in a disaster: premises, people, systems, and suppliers and other dependencies. All scenarios can be reduced to\nthese four categories and can be handled simultaneously. There are very few special scenarios which justify an additional separate analysis, it is a good idea to\nuse best practices and external advice for such an important topic, especially since knowledge of the right level of preparedness and the judgment about\nadequacy of the measures taken is not available in every organization. The recovery time objectives (RTOs) are based on the essential business processes\nrequired to ensure the organization's survival, therefore it would be inappropriate for them to be based on IT capabilities. Best practice guidelines recommend\nhaving 20%-40% of normal capacity available at an emergency site; therefore, a value of 50% would not be a problem if there are no additional factors.",

The walk- through test is the most basic type of\ntesting. Its intention is to make key staff familiar with the plan and discuss critical plan elements, rather than verifying its adequacy.

For example, invoices are numbered sequentially. The day's invoice begins with 12001 and ends with 15045. If any invoice larger than 15045\nis encountered during processing, that invoice would be rejected as an invalid invoice number.\n\nLimit Check Data should not exceed a predefined amount. For example, payroll checks should not exceed US $ 4000. If a check exceeds US $ 4000, data would\nbe rejected for further verification/authorization.\n\nValidity Check Programmed checking of data validity in accordance with predefined criteria. For example, a payroll record contains a field for marital status and\nthe acceptable status codes are M or S. If any other code is entered, record should be rejected.\n\nRange Check Data should not exceed a predefined range of values. For example, product type code range from 100 to 250. Any code outside this range should\nbe rejected as an invalid product type. Reasonableness check Input data are matched to predefined reasonable limits or occurrence rates. For example, a widget\nmanufacturer usually receives an order for no more than 20 widgets. If an order for more than 20 widgets is received, the computer program should be designed to\nprint the record with a warning indicating that the order appears unreasonable.\n\nTable Lookups Input data comply with predefined criteria maintained in computerized table of possible values. For example, an input check enters a city code of 1\nto 10. This number corresponds with a computerize table that matches a code to a city name.\n\nExistence Check Data are entered correctly and agree with valid predefined criteria. For example, a valid transaction code must be entered in transaction code\nfield.\n\nKey verification The keying process is repeated by a separate individual using a machine that compares the original key stroke to the repeated keyed input. For\nex. the worker number is keyed twice and compared to verify the keying process.\n\nCheck digit a numeric value that has been calculated mathematically is added to a data to ensure that original data have not been p[ altered or incorrect, but\nValid, value substituted. This control is effective in detecting transposition and transcription error. For ex. A check digit is added to an account number so it can be\nchecked for accuracy when it is used.\n\nCompleteness check a filed should always contain data rather than zero or blanks. A check of each byte of that field should be performed to determine that some\nform of data, or not blanks or zeros, is present. For ex. A worker number on a new employee record is left blank. His is identified as a key in filed and the record\nwould be rejected, with a request that the field be completed before the record is accepted for processing.\n\nDuplicate check new transaction is matched to those previously input to ensure that they have not already been entered. For ex. A vendor invoice number agrees\nwith previously recorded invoice to ensure that the current order is not a duplicate and, therefore, the vendor will not be paid twice.\n\nLogical relationship check if a particular condition is true, then one or more additional conditions or data input relationship may be required to be true and consider\nthe input valid. For ex. The hire data of an employee may be required to be true and consider the input valid. For ex. The hire date of an employee may be\nrequired to be more than 16 years past his her date of birth.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nTable Lookups Input data comply with predefined criteria maintained in computerized table of possible values.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Acquisition, Development and Implementation In a duplicate check control new transaction are matched to those previously input to\nensure that they have not already been entered. For ex. A vendor invoice number agrees with previously recorded invoice to ensure that the current order is not a\nduplicate and, therefore, the vendor will not be paid twice.\n\nFor CISA exam you should know below mentioned data validation edits and controls\n\nSequence Check The control number follows sequentially and any sequence or duplicated control numbers are rejected or noted on an exception report for\nfollow-up purposes. For example, invoices are numbered sequentially. The day's invoice begins with 12001 and ends with 15045. If any invoice larger than 15045\nis encountered during processing, that invoice would be rejected as an invalid invoice number.\n\nLimit Check Data should not exceed a predefined amount. For example, payroll checks should not exceed US $ 4000. If a check exceeds US $ 4000, data would\nbe rejected for further verification/authorization.\n\nValidity Check Programmed checking of data validity in accordance with predefined criteria. For example, a payroll record contains a field for marital status and\nthe acceptable status codes are M or S. If any other code is entered, record should be rejected.\n\nRange Check Data should not exceed a predefined range of values. For example, product type code range from 100 to 250. Any code outside this range should\nbe rejected as an invalid product type.\n\nReasonableness check Input data are matched to predefined reasonable limits or occurrence rates. For example, a widget manufacturer usually receives an\norder for no more than 20 widgets. If an order for more than 20 widgets is received, the computer program should be designed to print the record with a warning\nindicating that the order appears unreasonable.\n\nTable Lookups Input data comply with predefined criteria maintained in computerized table of possible values. For example, an input check enters a city code of 1\nto 10. This number corresponds with a computerize table that matches a code to a city name.\n\nExistence Check Data are entered correctly and agree with valid predefined criteria. For example, a valid transaction code must be entered in transaction code\nfield.\n\nKey verification The keying process is repeated by a separate individual using a machine that compares the original key stroke to the repeated keyed input. For\nex. the worker number is keyed twice and compared to verify the keying process.\n\nCheck digit a numeric value that has been calculated mathematically is added to a data to ensure that original data have not been p[ altered or incorrect, but\nValid, value substituted. This control is effective in detecting transposition and transcription error. For ex. A check digit is added to an account number so it can be\nchecked for accuracy when it is used.\n\nCompleteness check a filed should always contain data rather than zero or blanks. A check of each byte of that field should be performed to determine that some\nform of data, or not blanks or zeros, is present. For ex. A worker number on a new employee record is left blank. His is identified as a key in filed and the record\nwould be rejected, with a request that the field be completed before the record is accepted for processing.\n\nDuplicate check new transaction is matched to those previously input to ensure that they have not already been entered. For ex. A vendor invoice number agrees\nwith previously recorded invoice to ensure that the current order is not a duplicate and, therefore, the vendor will not be paid twice.\n\nLogical relationship check if a particular condition is true, then one or more additional conditions or data input relationship may be required to be true and consider\nthe input valid. For ex. The hire data of an employee may be required to be true and consider the input valid. For ex. The hire date of an employee may be\nrequired to be more than 16 years past his/her date of birth.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nRange Check Data should not exceed a predefined range of values.

The issuer will verify payer's signature on the payment and transfer the fund from the payer's account to the payee's account.\n\nFor CISA exam you should know below information about payment systems\n\nThere are two types of parties involved in all payment systems the issuer and the user. An issuer is an entity that operates the payment service. An issuer holds\nthe items that the payment represents. The user of the payment service performs two main functions- making payments and receiving payments and therefore\ncan be described as a payer or payee receptively.\n\nElectronic Money Model The objective of electronic money systems is emulating physical cash. An issuer attempts to do this by creating digital certificates, which\nare then purchased by users who redeem them with the issuer at a later date. In the interim, certificates can be transferred among users to trade for goods or\nservices. For the certificate to take on some of the attributes of physical cash, certain techniques are used so that when a certificate is deposited, the issuer can\nnot determine the original withdrawer of the certificate.

The complete data architecture consists of two components\n\nThe enterprise data flow architecture (EDFA)\nA logical data architecture\n\nVarious layers/components of this data flow architecture are as follows:\n\nPresentation/desktop access layer This is where end users directly deal with information. This layer includes familiar desktop tools such as spreadsheets, direct\nquerying tools, reporting and analysis suits offered by vendors such as Congas and business objects, and purpose built application such as balanced source cards\nand digital dashboards.\n\nData Source Layer Enterprise information derives from number of sources:\n\nOperational data Data captured and maintained by an organization's existing systems, and usually held in system-specific database or flat files.\nExternal Data Data provided to an organization by external sources. This could include data such as customer demographic and market share information.\nNonoperational data Information needed by end user that is not currently maintained in a computer accessible format.\n\nCore data warehouse This is where all the data of interest to an organization is captured and organized to assist reporting and analysis. DWs are normally\ninstituted as large relational databases. A property constituted DW should support three basic form of an inquiry.\n\nDrilling up and drilling down Using dimension of interest to the business, it should be possible to aggregate data as well as drill down. Attributes available at the\nmore granular levels of the warehouse can also be used to refine the analysis.\n\nDrill across Use common attributes to access a cross section of information in the warehouse such as sum\n\nsales across all product lines by customer and group of customers according to length of association with the company.\nHistorical Analysis The warehouse should support this by holding historical, time variant data. An example of historical analysis would be to report monthly store\nsales and then repeat the analysis using only customer who were preexisting at the start of the year in order to separate the effective new customer from the ability\nto generate repeat business with existing customers.\n\fData Mart Layer Data mart represents subset of information from the core DW selected and organized to meet the needs of a particular business unit or business\nline. Data mart can be relational databases or some form on-line analytical processing (OLAP) data structure.\n\nData Staging and quality layer This layer is responsible for data copying, transformation into DW format and quality control. It is particularly important that only\nreliable data into core DW. This layer needs to be able to deal with problems periodically thrown by operational systems such as change to account number format\nand reuse of old accounts and customer numbers.\n\nData Access Layer This layer operates to connect the data storage and quality layer with data stores in the data source layer and, in the process, avoiding the\nneed to know to know exactly how these data stores are organized. Technology now permits SQL access to data even if it is not stored in a relational database.\n\nData Preparation layer This layer is concerned with the assembly and preparation of data for loading into data marts. The usual practice is to per-calculate the\nvalues that are loaded into OLAP data repositories to increase access speed. Data mining is concern with exploring large volume of data to determine patterns\nand trends of information. Data mining often identifies patterns that are counterintuitive due to number and complexity of data relationships. Data quality needs to\nbe very high to not corrupt the result.\n\nMetadata repository layer Metadata are data about data. The information held in metadata layer needs to extend beyond data structure names and formats to\nprovide detail on business purpose and context. The metadata layer should be comprehensive in scope, covering data as they flow between the various layers,\nincluding documenting transformation and validation rules.\n\nWarehouse Management Layer The function of this layer is the scheduling of the tasks necessary to build and maintain the DW and populate data marts. This\nlayer is also involved in administration of security.\n\nApplication messaging layer This layer is concerned with transporting information between the various layers. In addition to business data, this layer\nencompasses generation, storage and targeted communication of control messages.\n\nInternet/Intranet layer This layer is concerned with basic data communication.

This layer includes familiar desktop tools such as spreadsheets, direct\nquerying tools, reporting and analysis suits offered by vendors such as Congas and business objects, and purpose built application such as balanced source cards\nand digital dashboards.\n\nData Source Layer Enterprise information derives from number of sources:\n\nOperational data Data captured and maintained by an organization's existing systems, and usually held in system-specific database or flat files.\nExternal Data Data provided to an organization by external sources. This could include data such as customer demographic and market share information.\nNonoperational data Information needed by end user that is not currently maintained in a computer accessible format.\n\nCore data warehouse This is where all the data of interest to an organization is captured and organized to assist reporting and analysis. DWs are normally\ninstituted as large relational databases. A property constituted\n\nDW should support three basic form of an inquiry.\n\nDrilling up and drilling down Using dimension of interest to the business, it should be possible to aggregate data as well as drill down.

An example of historical analysis would be to report monthly store\nsales and then repeat the analysis using only customer who were preexisting at the start of the year in order to separate the effective new customer from the ability\nto generate repeat business with existing customers.\n\nData Mart Layer Data mart represents subset of information from the core DW selected and organized to meet the needs of a particular business unit or business\nline. Data mart can be relational databases or some form on-line analytical processing (OLAP) data structure.\n\fData Staging and quality layer This layer is responsible for data copying, transformation into DW format and quality control.

It has been replaced by ISO/IEC\n25010:2011.[1] The fundamental objective of the ISO/IEC 9126 standard is to address some of the well-known human biases that can adversely affect the delivery\nand perception of a software development project. These biases include changing priorities after the start of a project or not having any clear definitions of\n\"success.\" By clarifying, then agreeing on the project priorities and subsequently converting abstract priorities (compliance) to measurable values (output data can\nbe validated against schema X with zero intervention), ISO/IEC 9126 tries to develop a common understanding of the project's objectives and goals.\n\nISO 9126\n\fThe standard is divided into four parts:\n\nQuality model\nExternal metrics\nInternal metrics\nQuality in use metrics.\n\nQuality Model\nThe quality model presented in the first part of the standard, ISO/IEC 9126-1,[2] classifies software quality in a\n\nstructured set of characteristics and sub-characteristics as follows:\n\nFunctionality - A set of attributes that bear on the existence of a set of functions and their specified properties.\nThe functions are those that satisfy stated or implied needs.\nSuitability\nAccuracy\nInteroperability\nSecurity\nFunctionality Compliance\n\nReliability - A set of attributes that bear on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period of time.\nMaturity\nFault Tolerance\nRecoverability\nReliability Compliance\n\nUsability - A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assessment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users.\nUnderstandability\nLearn ability\nOperability\nAttractiveness\nUsability Compliance\n\nEfficiency - A set of attributes that bear on the relationship between the level of performance of the software and the amount of resources used, under stated\nconditions.\nTime Behavior\nResource Utilization\nEfficiency Compliance\n\fMaintainability - A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed to make specified modifications.\nAnalyzability\nChangeability\nStability\nTestability\nMaintainability Compliance\n\nPortability - A set of attributes that bear on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another.\nAdaptability\nInstall ability\nCo-Existence\nReplace ability\nPortability Compliance\n\nEach quality sub-characteristic (e.g. adaptability) is further divided into attributes. An attribute is an entity which can be verified or measured in the software\nproduct. Attributes are not defined in the standard, as they vary between different software products.\n\nSoftware product is defined in a broad sense: it encompasses executables, source code, architecture descriptions, and so on. As a result, the notion of user\nextends to operators as well as to programmers, which are users of components such as software libraries.\n\nThe standard provides a framework for organizations to define a quality model for a software product. On doing so, however, it leaves up to each organization the\ntask of specifying precisely its own model. This may be done, for example, by specifying target values for quality metrics which evaluates the degree of presence\nof quality attributes.\n\nInternal Metrics\nInternal metrics are those which do not rely on software execution (static measure)\n\nExternal Metrics\nExternal metrics are applicable to running software.\nQuality in Use Metrics\n\nQuality in use metrics are only available when the final product is used in real conditions. Ideally, the internal quality determines the external quality and external\nquality determines quality in use.\n\nThis standard stems from the GE model for describing software quality, presented in 1977 by McCall et al., which is organized around three types of Quality\nCharacteristics:\n\nFactors (To specify): They describe the external view of the software, as viewed by the users. Criteria (To build): They describe the internal view of the software,\nas seen by the developer. Metrics (To control): They are defined and used to provide a scale and method for measurement.\n\nISO/IEC 9126 distinguishes between a defect and a nonconformity, a defect being The nonfulfillment of intended usage requirements, whereas a nonconformity is\nThe nonfulfillment of specified requirements. A similar distinction is made between validation and verification, known as V&V in the testing trade.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\nReliability - A set of attributes that bear on the capability of software to maintain its level of performance under stated conditions for a stated period of time.\nUsability - A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed for use, and on the individual assessment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users.\nMaintainability - A set of attributes that bear on the effort needed to make specified modifications.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 188",

This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have\nwanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors do not violate any defined rules.\n\nFor CISA exam you should know below information about ACID properties in DBMS:\n\nAtomicity - Atomicity requires that each transaction is \"all or nothing\": if one part of the transaction fails, the\n\nentire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures,\nerrors, and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible (\"atomic\"), and an aborted transaction\ndoes not happen.\n\nConsistency - The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must\nbe valid according to all defined rules, including but not limited to constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee\ncorrectness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any\nprogramming errors do not violate any defined rules.\n\nIsolation - The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were\nexecuted serially, i.e. one after the other. Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on concurrency control method, the effects of an\nincomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.[citation needed]\n\nDurability - Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational\ndatabase, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter).\nTo defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\nAtomicity - Atomicity requires that each transaction is \"all or nothing\": if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left\nunchanged.\n\nIsolation - The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were\nexecuted serially, i.e. one after the other.\n\fDurability - Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 218",

It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed\niterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen tight iterations throughout the\ndevelopment cycle.\n\nAgile Development\n\fThe Agile Manifesto introduced the term in 2001. Since then, the Agile Movement, with all its values, principles, methods, practices, tools, champions and\npractitioners, philosophies and cultures, has significantly changed the landscape of the modern software engineering and commercial software development in the\nInternet era.\n\nAgile principles\n\nThe Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles:\n\nCustomer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development\nWorking software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers Projects are built around\nmotivated individuals, who should be trusted Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location) Working software is the principal measure\nof progress\nSustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design\nSimplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential Self-organizing teams\nRegular adaptation to changing circumstances\n\nWhat is Scrum?\nScrum is the most popular way of introducing Agility due to its simplicity and flexibility. Because of this popularity, many organizations claim to be \"doing Scrum\"\nbut aren't doing anything close to Scrum's actual definition. Scrum emphasizes empirical feedback, team self-management, and striving to build properly tested\nproduct increments within short iterations. Doing Scrum as it's actually defined usually comes into conflict with existing habits at established non-Agile\norganizations.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nSoftware prototyping- Software prototyping, refers to the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program\nbeing developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development and is comparable to prototyping as known from other fields, such as mechanical\nengineering or manufacturing.\n\nRapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. The \"planning\" of software\ndeveloped using RAD is interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive per-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and\nmakes it easier to change requirements.\n\nComponent Based Development - It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into systems.\nThis practice aims to bring about an equally wide- ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term and the long-term for the software itself and for organizations\nthat sponsor such software.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 194",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Acquisition, Development and Implementation Component-based software engineering (CBSE) (also known as component-based\ndevelopment (CBD)) is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the separation of concerns in respect of the wide-ranging functionality available\nthroughout a given software system. It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into\nsystems. This practice aims to bring about an equally wide-ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term and the long-term for the software itself and for\norganizations that sponsor such software.\n\nSoftware engineers[who?] regard components as part of the starting platform for service-orientation. Components play this role, for example, in web services, and\nmore recently, in service-oriented architectures (SOA), whereby a component is converted by the web service into a service and subsequently inherits further\ncharacteristics beyond that of an ordinary component.\n\nComponents can produce or consume events and can be used for event-driven architectures (EDA).\n\nDefinition and characteristics of components\n\nAn individual software component is a software package, a web service, a web resource, or a module that encapsulates a set of related functions (or data).\nAll system processes are placed into separate components so that all of the data and functions inside each component are semantically related (just as with the\ncontents of classes). Because of this principle, it is often said that components are modular and cohesive.\n\nWith regard to system-wide co-ordination, components communicate with each other via interfaces. When a component offers services to the rest of the system, it\nadopts a provided interface that specifies the services that other components can utilize, and how they can do so. This interface can be seen as a signature of the\ncomponent - the client does not need to know about the inner workings of the component (implementation) in order to make use of it. This principle results in\ncomponents referred to as encapsulated. The UML illustrations within this article represent provided interfaces by a lollipop-symbol attached to the outer edge of\nthe component.\n\nHowever, when a component needs to use another component in order to function, it adopts a used interface that specifies the services that it needs. In the UML\nillustrations in this article, used interfaces are represented by an open socket symbol attached to the outer edge of the component. A simple example of several\nsoftware components - pictured within a hypothetical holiday-reservation system represented in UML 2.0.\n\nAnother important attribute of components is that they are substitutable, so that a component can replace another (at design time or run-time), if the successor\ncomponent meets the requirements of the initial component (expressed via the interfaces). Consequently, components can be replaced with either an updated\nversion or an alternative without breaking the system in which the component operates.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb for engineers substituting components, component B can immediately replace component A, if component B provides at least what\ncomponent A provided and uses no more than what component A used.\n\nSoftware components often take the form of objects (not classes) or collections of objects (from object-oriented programming), in some binary or textual form,\nadhering to some interface description language (IDL) so that the component may exist autonomously from other components in a computer.\n\nWhen a component is to be accessed or shared across execution contexts or network links, techniques such as serialization or marshalling are often employed to\ndeliver the component to its destination.\n\nReusability is an important characteristic of a high-quality software component. Programmers should design and implement software components in such a way\nthat many different programs can reuse them.\n\nFurthermore, component-based usability testing should be considered when software components directly interact with users.\n\nIt takes significant effort and awareness to write a software component that is effectively reusable. The component needs to be:\n\nfully documented\nthoroughly tested\nrobust - with comprehensive input-validity checking\nable to pass back appropriate error messages or return codes\ndesigned with an awareness that it will be put to unforeseen uses\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nAgile Development - Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development, where\nrequirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.\n\nSoftware prototyping- Software prototyping, refers to the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program\nbeing developed.

The lack of\nextensive per-planning generally allows software to be written much faster, and makes it easier to change requirements.\nRapid Application Development\n\fFour phases of RAD\nRequirements Planning phase combines elements of the system planning and systems analysis phases of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Users,\nmanagers, and IT staff members discuss and agree on business needs, project scope, constraints, and system requirements. It ends when the team agrees on\nthe key issues and obtains management authorization to continue.\nUser design phase during this phase, users interact with systems analysts and develop models and prototypes that represent all system processes, inputs, and\noutputs. The RAD groups or subgroups typically use a combination of Joint Application Development (JAD) techniques and CASE tools to translate user needs\ninto working models. User Design is a continuous interactive process that allows users to understand, modify, and eventually approve a working model of the\nsystem that meets their needs.\n\nConstruction phase focuses on program and application development task similar to the SDLC. In RAD, however, users continue to participate and can still\nsuggest changes or improvements as actual screens or reports are developed. Its tasks are programming and application development, coding, unit-integration\nand system testing.\n\nCutover phase resembles the final tasks in the SDLC implementation phase, including data conversion, testing, changeover to the new system, and user training.\nCompared with traditional methods, the entire process is compressed.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Acquisition, Development and Implementation For CISA exam you should know below information about Functional Point Analysis:\n\nFunction Point Analysis (FPA) is an ISO recognized method to measure the functional size of an information system. The functional size reflects the amount of\nfunctionality that is relevant to and recognized by the user in the business. It is independent of the technology used to implement the system.\n\nThe unit of measurement is \"function points\". So, FPA expresses the functional size of an information system in a number of function points (for example: the size\nof a system is 314 fop's).\nThe functional size may be used:\n\nTo budget application development or enhancement costs\nTo budget the annual maintenance costs of the application portfolio To determine project productivity after completion of the project To determine the Software\n\fSize for cost estimating\n\nAll software applications will have numerous elementary processes or independent processes to move data. Transactions (or elementary processes) that bring\ndata from outside the application domain (or application boundary) to inside that application boundary are referred to as external inputs. Transactions (or\nelementary processes) that take data from a resting position (normally on a file) to outside the application domain (or application boundary) are referred as either\nan external outputs or external inquiries. Data at rest that is maintained by the application in question is classified as internal logical files. Data at rest that is\nmaintained by another application in question is classified as external interface files.\nTypes of Function Point Counts:\n\nDevelopment Project Function Point Count\nFunction Points can be counted at all phases of a development project from requirements up to and including implementation. This type of count is associated with\nnew development work. Scope creep can be tracked and monitored by understanding the functional size at all phase of a project. Frequently, this type of count is\ncalled a baseline function point count.\n\nEnhancement Project Function Point Count\n\nIt is common to enhance software after it has been placed into production. This type of function point count tries to size enhancement projects. All production\napplications evolve over time. By tracking enhancement size and associated costs a historical database for your organization can be built. Additionally, it is\nimportant to understand how a Development project has changed over time.\n\nApplication Function Point Count\nApplication counts are done on existing production applications. This \"baseline count\" can be used with overall application metrics like total maintenance hours.\nThis metric can be used to track maintenance hours per function point. This is an example of a normalized metric. It is not enough to examine only maintenance,\nbut one must examine the ratio of maintenance hours to size of the application to get a true picture.\nProductivity:\n\nThe definition of productivity is the output-input ratio within a time period with due consideration for quality. Productivity = outputs/inputs (within a time period,\nquality considered)\n\nThe formula indicates that productivity can be improved by (1) by increasing outputs with the same inputs, (2) by decreasing inputs but maintaining the same\noutputs, or (3) by increasing outputs and decreasing inputs change the ratio favorably.\n\nSoftware Productivity = Function Points / Inputs\n\nEffectiveness vs. Efficiency:\nProductivity implies effectiveness and efficiency in individual and organizational performance. Effectiveness is the achievement of objectives. Efficiency is the\nachievement of the ends with least amount of resources.\n\nSoftware productivity is defined as hours/function points or function points/hours. This is the average cost to develop software or the unit cost of software. One\nthing to keep in mind is the unit cost of software is not fixed with size. What industry data shows is the unit cost of software goes up with size.\n\nAverage cost is the total cost of producing a particular quantity of output divided by that quantity. In this case to Total Cost/Function Points. Marginal cost is the\nchange in total cost attributable to a one-unit change in output.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why marginal costs for software increase as size increases. The following is a list of some of the reasons\nAs size becomes larger complexity increases.\nAs size becomes larger a greater number of tasks need to be completed. As size becomes larger there is a greater number of staff members and they become\nmore difficult to manage.\n\nFunction Points are the output of the software development process. Function points are the unit of software. It is very important to understand that Function\nPoints remain constant regardless who develops the software or what language the software is developed in. Unit costs need to be examined very closely. To\ncalculate average unit cost all items (units) are combined and divided by the total cost. On the other hand, to accurately estimate the cost of an application each\ncomponent cost needs to be estimated.\n\nDetermine type of function point count\nDetermine the application boundary\nIdentify and rate transactional function types to determine their contribution to the unadjusted function point count.\nIdentify and rate data function types to determine their contribution to the unadjusted function point count.\nDetermine the value adjustment factor (VAF)\nCalculate the adjusted function point count.\n\nTo complete a function point count knowledge of function point rules and application documentation is needed. Access to an application expert can improve the\nquality of the count. Once the application boundary has been established, FPA can be broken into three major parts\n\nFPA for transactional function types\nFPA for data function types\nFPA for GSCs\n\nRating of transactions is dependent on both information contained in the transactions and the number of files referenced, it is recommended that transactions are\ncounted first. At the same time a tally should be kept of all FTR's (file types referenced) that the transactions reference. Every FTR must have at least one or more\ntransactions. Each transaction must be an elementary process. An elementary process is the smallest unit of activity that is meaningful to the end user in the\nbusiness. It must be self-contained and leave the business in consistent state\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nCritical Path Methodology - The critical path method (CPM) is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities\n\nGantt Chart - A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, developed by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and\nfinish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the\nproject. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e. precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current\nschedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical \"TODAY\" line as shown here.\n\nTime box Management - In time management, a time boxing allocates a fixed time period, called a time box, to each planned activity. Several project management\napproaches use time boxing. It is also used for individual use to address personal tasks in a smaller time frame. It often involves having deliverables and\ndeadlines, which will improve the productivity of the user.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 154",

In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to\nexercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).\n\nWhite-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box\ntesting as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during\nintegration, and between subsystems during a systemlevel test.

Develop an estimate of the ROI created by the proposed change. Elaborate on the benefit with a preliminary project plan to\ngain sponsorship from the organization. The plan should define the areas to be reviewed and clarify the desired result at the end of the project (aka end state\nobjective). The deliverables of the envision phase include the following:\nProject champion working with the steering committee to gain top management approval Brief description of project scope, goals, and objectives description of the\nspecific deliverables from this project with a preliminary charter to evidence management's approval, the project may proceed into the initiation phase.\n\nInitiate -This phase involves setting BPR goals with the sponsor. Focus on planning the collection of detailed evidence necessary to build the subsequent BPR\nplan for redesigning the process. Deliverables in the initiation phase include the following:\nIdentifying internal and external requirements (project specifications) Business case explaining why this project makes sense (justification) and the estimated\nreturn on investment compared to the total cost (net ROI)\nFormal project plan with budget, schedule, staffing plan, procurement plan, deliverables, and project risk analysis\nLevel of authority the BPR project manager will hold and the composition of any support committee or task force that will be required\nFrom the profit and loss (P&L) statement, identify the item line number that money will be debited from to pay for this project and identify the specific P&L line\nnumber that the financial return will later appear under (to provide strict monitoring of the ROI performance)\nFormal project charter signed by the sponsors It's important to realize that some BPR projects will proceed to their planned conclusion and others may be halted\nbecause of insufficient evidence. After a plan is formally approved, the\nBPR project may proceed to the diagnostic phase.\n\nDiagnose Document existing processes. Now it's time to see what is working and identify the source of each requirement. Each process step is reviewed to\ncalculate the value it creates. The goal of the diagnostic phase is to gain a better understanding of existing processes. The data collected in the diagnostic phase\nforms the basis of all planning decisions:\nDetailed documentation of the existing process\nPerformance measurement of individual steps in the process\nEvidence of specific process steps that add customer value\nIdentification of process steps that don't add value\nDefinition of attributes that create value and quality\nPut in the extra effort to do a good job of collecting and analyzing the evidence. All future assumptions will be\n\nbased on evidence from the diagnostic phase.\n\nRedesign- Using the evidence from the diagnostic phase, it's time to develop the new process. This will take several planning iterations to ensure that the strategic\nobjectives are met. The formal redesign plans will be reviewed by sponsors and stakeholders. A final plan will be presented to the steering committee for approval.\nHere's an example of deliverables from the redesign phase. Comparison of the envisioned objective to actual specifications Analysis of alternatives (AoA)\nPrototyping and testing of the redesigned process\nFormal documentation of the final design\nThe project will need formal approval to proceed into the reconstruction phase. Otherwise, the redesign is halted pending further scrutiny while comparing the\nproposed design with available evidence. Insufficient evidence warrants halting the project.\n\nReconstruct With formal approval received, it's time to begin the implementation phase. The current processes are deconstructed and reassembled according to\nthe plan. Reconstruction may be in the form of a parallel process, modular changes, or complete transition. Each method presents a unique risk and reward\nopportunity. Deliverables from this phase include the following:\nConversion plan with dependencies in time sequence\nChange control management\nExecution of conversion plan with progress monitoring\nTraining of users and support personnel\nPilot implementation to ensure a smooth migration Formal approval by the sponsor. The reconstructed process must be formally approved by management to\nwitness their consent for fitness of use. IT governance dictates that executive management shall be held responsible for any failures and receive recognition for\nexceptional results. System performance will be evaluated again after entering production use.\n\nEvaluate (post evaluation) The reconstructed process is monitored to ensure that it works and is producing the strategic value as forecast in the original\njustification.\nComparison of original forecast to actual performance Identification of lessons learned Total quality management plan to maintain the new process\nA method of continuous improvement is implemented to track the original goals against actual process performance. Annual reevaluation is needed to adapt new\nrequirements or new opportunities.\n\nBenchmarking as a BPR Tool\nBenchmarking is the process of comparing performance data (aka metrics). It can be used to evaluate business processes that are under consideration for\nreengineering. Performance data may be obtained by using a self-assessment or by auditing for compliance against a standard (reference standard). Evidence\ncaptured during the diagnostic phase is considered the key to identifying areas for performance improvement and documenting obstacles. ISACA offers the\nfollowing general guidelines for performing benchmarks:\n\nPlan Identify the critical processes and create measurement techniques to grade the processes. Research Use information about the process and collect regular\ndata (samples) to build a baseline for comparison. Consider input from your customers and use analogous data from other industries. Observe Gather internal\n\fdata and external data from a benchmark partner to aid the comparison results. Benchmark data can also be compared against published standards. Analyze\nLook for root cause-effect relationships and other dependencies in the process. Use predefined tools and procedures to collate the data collected from all available\nsources. Adapt Translate the findings into hypotheses of how these findings will help or hurt strategic business goals.\nDesign a pilot test to prove or disprove the hypotheses.\nImprove Implement a prototype of the new processes. Study the impact and note any unexpected results. Revise the process by using controlled change\nmanagement. Measure the process results again. Use reestablished procedures such as total quality management for continuous improvement.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nThe other options specified does not represent the correct sequence of BRP benchmarking steps.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 219 to 211\nCISA certified information system auditor study guide Second Edition Page Number 154 to 158",

Deliverables in the initiation phase include the following:\n\nIdentifying internal and external requirements (project specifications) Business case explaining why this project makes sense (justification) and the estimated\nreturn on investment compared to the total cost (net ROI)\nFormal project plan with budget, schedule, staffing plan, procurement plan, deliverables, and project risk\n\nanalysis\nLevel of authority the BPR project manager will hold and the composition of any support committee or task force that will be required\nFrom the profit and loss (P&L) statement, identify the item line number that money will be debited from to pay for this project and identify the specific P&L line\nnumber that the financial return will later appear under (to provide strict monitoring of the ROI performance)\nFormal project charter signed by the sponsors\n\nIt's important to realize that some BPR projects will proceed to their planned conclusion and others may be halted because of insufficient evidence. After a plan is\nformally approved, the BPR project may proceed to the diagnostic phase.\n\nDiagnose Document existing processes. Now it's time to see what is working and identify the source of each requirement. Each process step is reviewed to\ncalculate the value it creates. The goal of the diagnostic phase is to gain a better understanding of existing processes. The data collected in the diagnostic phase\nforms the basis of all planning decisions:\n\nDetailed documentation of the existing process\nPerformance measurement of individual steps in the process\nEvidence of specific process steps that add customer value\nIdentification of process steps that don't add value\nDefinition of attributes that create value and quality\nPut in the extra effort to do a good job of collecting and analyzing the evidence. All future assumptions will be based on evidence from the diagnostic phase.\n\nRedesign- Using the evidence from the diagnostic phase, it's time to develop the new process. This will take several planning iterations to ensure that the strategic\nobjectives are met. The formal redesign plans will be reviewed by sponsors and stakeholders. A final plan will be presented to the steering committee for approval.\nHere's an example of deliverables from the redesign phase.\n\nComparison of the envisioned objective to actual specifications Analysis of alternatives (AoA)\nPrototyping and testing of the redesigned process\nFormal documentation of the final design\n\nThe project will need formal approval to proceed into the reconstruction phase. Otherwise, the redesign is halted pending further scrutiny while comparing the\nproposed design with available evidence. Insufficient evidence warrants halting the project.\n\nReconstruct With formal approval received, it's time to begin the implementation phase. The current processes are deconstructed and reassembled according to\nthe plan. Reconstruction may be in the form of a parallel process, modular changes, or complete transition. Each method presents a unique risk and reward\nopportunity. Deliverables from this phase include the following:\n\nConversion plan with dependencies in time sequence\nChange control management\nExecution of conversion plan with progress monitoring\n\fTraining of users and support personnel\nPilot implementation to ensure a smooth migration\nFormal approval by the sponsor.\n\nThe reconstructed process must be formally approved by management to witness their consent for fitness of use. IT governance dictates that executive\nmanagement shall be held responsible for any failures and receive recognition for exceptional results. System performance will be evaluated again after entering\nproduction use.\n\nEvaluate (post evaluation) The reconstructed process is monitored to ensure that it works and is producing the strategic value as forecast in the original\njustification.\nComparison of original forecast to actual performance Identification of lessons learned\n\nTotal quality management plan to maintain the new process\nA method of continuous improvement is implemented to track the original goals against actual process performance. Annual reevaluation is needed to adapt new\nrequirements or new opportunities.\n\nBenchmarking as a BPR Tool\nBenchmarking is the process of comparing performance data (aka metrics). It can be used to evaluate business processes that are under consideration for\nreengineering. Performance data may be obtained by using a self-assessment or by auditing for compliance against a standard (reference standard). Evidence\ncaptured during the diagnostic phase is considered the key to identifying areas for performance improvement and documenting obstacles. ISACA offers the\nfollowing general guidelines for performing benchmarks:\n\nPlan Identify the critical processes and create measurement techniques to grade the processes. Research Use information about the process and collect regular\ndata (samples) to build a baseline for comparison. Consider input from your customers and use analogous data from other industries. Observe Gather internal\ndata and external data from a benchmark partner to aid the comparison results. Benchmark data can also be compared against published standards. Analyze\nLook for root cause-effect relationships and other dependencies in the process. Use predefined tools and procedures to collate the data collected from all available\nsources. Adapt Translate the findings into hypotheses of how these findings will help or hurt strategic business goals.\nDesign a pilot test to prove or disprove the hypotheses.\nImprove Implement a prototype of the new processes. Study the impact and note any unexpected results. Revise the process by using controlled change\nmanagement. Measure the process results again. Use reestablished procedures such as total quality management for continuous improvement.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nThe other options specified does not represent the correct sequence of BRP application steps.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 219 to 211\nCISA certified information system auditor study guide Second Edition Page Number 154 to 158",

An ROI is computed when there is\npredictable savings or revenues that can be compared to the investment needed to realize the revenues. Amortization is used in a profit and loss statement, not in\ncomputing potential losses. Spending the time needed to define exactly the total amount is normally a wrong approach.

For example, an error in\nrequirements discovered in the testing phase can result in scrapping significant amounts of work.

When the degree of uncertainty of the system to be delivered\nand the conditions in which it will be used rises, the waterfall model has not been successful, in these circumstances, the various forms of iterative development\nlife cycle gives the advantage of breaking down the scope of the overall system to be delivered, making the requirements gathering and design activities more\nmanageable. The ability to deliver working software earlier also acts to alleviate uncertainty and may allow an earlier realization of benefits. The choice of a design\nand programming approach is not itself a determining factor of the type of software development life cycle that is appropriate. The use of new technology in a\nproject introduces a significant element of risk. An iterative form of development, particularly one of the agile methods that focuses on early development of actual\nworking software, is likely to be the better option to manage this uncertainty.",

The ability of the development staff can have a bearing on the quality of what is\nproduced; however, replacing staff can be expensive and disruptive, and the presence of a competent staff cannot guarantee quality in the absence of effective\nquality management processes.

One of the best ways to achieve this is that, at the end of each iteration, the team considers and documents\nwhat worked well and what could have worked better, and identifies improvements to be implemented in subsequent iterations. CMM and Agile really sit at\nopposite poles. CMM places heavy emphasis on predefined formal processes and formal project management and software development deliverables. Agile\nprojects, by contrast, rely on refinement of process as dictated by the particular needs of the project and team dynamics. Additionally, less importance is placed on\nformal paper- based deliverables, with the preference being effective informal communication within the team and with key outside contributors. Agile projects\nproduce releasable software in short iterations, typically ranging from 4 to 8 weeks. This, in itself, instills considerable performance discipline within the team. This,\ncombined with short daily meetings to agree on what the team is doing and the identification of any impediments, renders task-level tracking against a schedule\nredundant.

The\nlogistics of setting up and refreshing customized test data is easier if a separate environment is maintained. If developers and testers are sharing the same\nenvironment, they have to work effectively at separate times of the day. It is unlikely that this would provide optimum productivity. Use of a source code control tool\nis a good practice, but it does not properly mitigate the lack of an appropriate testing environment.

Parallel testing is the process of feeding data into two systems-the modified system and an alternate system- and comparing the\nresults. In this approach, the old and new systems operate concurrently for a period of time and perform the same processing functions. Pilot testing takes place\nfirst at one location and is then extended to other locations. The purpose is to see if the new system operates satisfactorily in one place before implementing it at\nother locations. Interface/integration testing is a hardware or software test that evaluates the connection of two or more components that pass information from\none area to another. The objective is to take unit-tested modules and build an integrated structure.",

Evaluating the cost of controls versus the quantum of risk is a valid management concern. However, in a high-risk\nsystem a comprehensive control framework is needed, intelligent design should permit additional detective and corrective controls to be established that don't\nhave high ongoing costs, e.g., automated interrogation of logs to highlight suspicious individual transactions or data patterns. Effective access controls are, in\nthemselves, a positive but, for reasons outlined above, may not sufficiently compensate for other control weaknesses.

Parity check (known as vertical\nredundancy check) also involves adding a bit (known as the parity bit) to each character during transmission.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nAlternative routing is a method of routing information via an alternate medium such as copper cable or fiber optics. This involves use of different networks, circuits\nor end points should the normal network be unavailable. Diverse routing routes traffic through split cable facilities or duplicate cable facilities. This can be\naccomplished with different and/or duplicate cable sheaths. If different cable sheaths are used, the cable may be in the same conduit and therefore subject to the\nsame interruptions as the cable it is backing up. The communication service subscriber can duplicate the facilities by having alternate routes, although the\nentrance to and from the customer premises may be in the same conduit. The subscriber can obtain diverse routing and alternate routing from the local carrier,\nincluding dual entrance facilities. This type of access is time-consuming and costly. Long haul network diversity is a diverse long-distance network utilizing T1\ncircuits among the major long-distance carriers. It ensures long-distance access should any one carrier experience a network failure. Last mile circuit protection is\na redundant combination of local carrier T1s microwave and/or coaxial cable access to the local communications loop. This enables the facility to have access\nduring a local carrier communication disaster. Alternate local carrier routing is also utilized.

In most circumstances, when commercial firewalls are breached that breach is facilitated by vulnerabilities in the\nunderlying operating system. Keeping all installation options available on the system further increases the risks of vulnerabilities and exploits. Using SSL for\nfirewall administration (choice A) is important, because changes in user and supply chain partners' roles and profiles will be dynamic. Therefore, it is appropriate to\nmaintain the firewall policies daily (choice B), and prudent to block all inbound traffic unless permitted (choice C).",

This technology might be used if a trade-off between security,\nperformance and costs has to be achieved. Proxy servers cache some data but normally cannot cache all pages to be published because this depends on the kind\nof information the web servers provide. The ability to accelerate access depends on the speed of the back-end servers, i.e., those that are cached. Thus, without\nmaking further assumptions, a gain in speed cannot be assured, but visualization and hiding of internal structures can. If speed is an issue, a scale- out approach\n(avoiding adding additional delays by passing firewalls, involving more servers, etc.) would be a better solution. Due to the limited caching option, reverse proxies\nare not suitable for enhancing fault tolerance. User requests that are handled by reverse proxy servers are using exactly the same bandwidth as direct requests to\nthe hosts providing the data.",

The term is typically used pejoratively. Although salami slicing is often used to carry\nout illegal activities, it is only a strategy for gaining an advantage over time by accumulating it in small increments, so it can be used in perfectly legal ways as well.\n\nAn example of salami slicing, also known as penny shaving, is the fraudulent practice of stealing money repeatedly in extremely small quantities, usually by taking\nadvantage of rounding to the nearest cent (or other monetary unit) in financial transactions. It would be done by always rounding down, and putting the fractions of\na cent into another account. The idea is to make the change small enough that any single transaction will go undetected.\n\nIn information security, a salami attack is a series of minor attacks that together results in a larger attack. Computers are ideally suited to automating this type of\nattack.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nEavesdropping is the act of secretly listening to the private conversation of others without their consent, as defined by Black's Law Dictionary. This is commonly\nthought to be unethical and there is an old adage that \"eavesdroppers seldom hear anything good of themselves...eavesdroppers always try to listen to matters\nthat concern them.\"\n\nTraffic analysis is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even\nwhen the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more\ncan be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is a\nconcern in computer security.\n\nMasquerading A masquerade attack is an attack that uses a fake identity, such as a network identity, to gain unauthorized access to personal computer\ninformation through legitimate access identification. If an authorization process is not fully protected, it can become extremely vulnerable to a masquerade attack.\nMasquerade attacks can be perpetrated using stolen passwords and logons, by locating gaps in programs, or by finding a way around the authentication process.\nThe attack can be triggered either by someone within the organization or by an outsider if the organization is connected to a public network.

Sniffers are typically devices that can collect information from a communication medium, such as a network. These devices can range from\nspecialized equipment to basic workstations with customized software. A sniffer can collect information about most, if not all, attributes of the communication. The\nmost common method of sniffing is to plug a sniffer into an existing network device like a hub or switch. A hub (which is designed to relay all traffic passing through\nit to all of its ports) will automatically begin sending all the traffic on that network segment to the sniffing device. On the other hand, a switch (which is designed to\nlimit what traffic gets sent to which port) will have to be specially configured to send all traffic to the port where the sniffer is plugged in.\n\nAnother method for sniffing is to use a network tap--a device that literally splits a network transmission into two identical streams; one going to the original network\ndestination and the other going to the sniffing device. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, including cost, feasibility, and the desire to\nmaintain the secrecy of the sniffing activity.\n\nThe packets captured by sniffer are decoded and then displayed by the sniffer. Therefore, if the username/ password are contained in a packet or packets\ntraversing the segment the sniffer is connected to, it will capture and display that information (and any other information on that segment it can see).\n\nOf course, if the information is encrypted via a VPN, SSL, TLS, or similar technology, the information is still captured and displayed, but it is in an unreadable\nformat.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nData did dlinginvolves changing data before, as it is entered into a computer, or after it is extracted.\n\nSpoofing is forging an address and inserting it into a packet to disguise the origin of the communication - or causing a system to respond to the wrong address.\n\nSurfing would refer to the surf attack, where an attacker sends spoofed packets to the broadcast address on a gateway in order to cause a denial of service.\nCISA Review manual 2014 Page number 321\nOfficial ISC2 Guide to the CISSP 3rd edition Page Number 153",

    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Operations, Maintenance and Support This is incorrect, there would be a pair of Security Association (SA) needed for bi directional\ncommunication and NOT only one SA. The sender and the receiver would both negotiate an SA for inbound and outbound connections.\n\nThe two main concepts of IPSec are Security Associations (SA) and tunneling. A Security Association (SA) is a simplex logical connection between two IPSec\nsystems. For bi-directional communication to be established\n\nbetween two IPSec systems, two separate Security Associations, one in each direction, must be defined.\n\nThe security protocols can either be AH or ESP.\n\nThe explanations below are a bit more thorough than what you need to know for the exam. However, they always say a picture is worth one thousand words, I\nthink it is very true when it comes to explaining IPSEC and it's inner working. I have found a great article from CISCO PRESS and DLINK covering this subject,\nsee references below.\n\nTunnel and Transport Modes\nIPSec can be run in either tunnel mode or transport mode. Each of these modes has its own particular uses and care should be taken to ensure that the correct\none is selected for the solution:\n\nTunnel mode is most commonly used between gateways, or at an end-station to a gateway, the gateway acting as a proxy for the hosts behind it.\n\nTransport mode is used between end-stations or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a host--for example, an encrypted\nTelnet session from a workstation to a router, in which the router is the actual destination.\n\nAs you can see in the Figure 1 graphic below, basically transport mode should be used for end-to-end sessions and tunnel mode should be used for everything\nelse.\nFIGURE: 1\n\n\n\n\nIPSEC Transport Mode versus Tunnel Mode\n\nTunnel and transport modes in IPSec.\n\nFigure 1 above displays some examples of when to use tunnel versus transport mode:\nTunnel mode is most commonly used to encrypt traffic between secure IPSec gateways, such as between the Cisco router and PIX Firewall (as shown in example\nA in Figure 1). The IPSec gateways proxy IPSec for the devices behind them, such as Alice's PC and the HR servers in Figure 1. In example A, Alice connects to\nthe HR servers securely through the IPSec tunnel set up between the gateways.\n\nTunnel mode is also used to connect an end-station running IPSec software, such as the Cisco Secure VPN Client, to an IPSec gateway, as shown in example B.\n\nIn example C, tunnel mode is used to set up an IPSec tunnel between the Cisco router and a server running IPSec software. Note that Cisco IOS software and the\nPIX Firewall sets tunnel mode as the default IPSec\n\nmode.\n\nTransport mode is used between end-stations supporting IPSec, or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is being treated as a host. In example\nD, transport mode is used to set up an encrypted Telnet session from Alice's PC running Cisco Secure VPN Client software to terminate at the PIX Firewall,\nenabling Alice to remotely configure the PIX Firewall securely.\nFIGURE: 2\n\fIPSEC AH Tunnel and Transport mode\n\nAH Tunnel Versus Transport Mode\nFigure 2 above, shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to AH. In transport mode, AH services protect the external IP header along with the data\npayload. AH services protect all the fields in the header that don't change in transport. The header goes after the IP header and before the ESP header, if present,\nand other higher-layer protocols.\n\nAs you can see in Figure 2 above, In tunnel mode, the entire original header is authenticated, a new IP header is built, and the new IP header is protected in the\nsame way as the IP header in transport mode.\n\nAH is incompatible with Network Address Translation (NAT) because NAT changes the source IP address, which breaks the AH header and causes the packets to\nbe rejected by the IPSec peer.\nFIGURE: 3\n\nIPSEC ESP Tunnel versus Transport modes\n\n\n\n\nESP Tunnel Versus Transport Mode\nFigure 3 above shows the differences that the IPSec mode makes to ESP. In transport mode, the IP payload is encrypted and the original headers are left intact.\nThe ESP header is inserted after the IP header and before the upper-layer protocol header. The upper-layer protocols are encrypted and authenticated along with\nthe ESP header. ESP doesn't authenticate the IP header itself.\n\nNOTE: Higher-layer information is not available because it's part of the encrypted payload.\n\fWhen ESP is used in tunnel mode, the original IP header is well protected because the entire original IP datagram is encrypted. With an ESP authentication\nmechanism, the original IP datagram and the ESP header are included; however, the new IP header is not included in the authentication.\n\nWhen both authentication and encryption are selected, encryption is performed first, before authentication. One reason for this order of processing is that it\nfacilitates rapid detection and rejection of replayed or bogus packets by the receiving node. Prior to decrypting the packet, the receiver can detect the problem and\npotentially reduce the impact of denial-of-service attacks.\n\nESP can also provide packet authentication with an optional field for authentication. Cisco IOS software and the PIX Firewall refer to this service as ESP hashed\nmessage authentication code (HMAC). Authentication is calculated after the encryption is done. The current IPSec standard specifies which hashing algorithms\nhave to be supported as the mandatory HMAC algorithms.\n\nThe main difference between the authentication provided by ESP and AH is the extent of the coverage. Specifically, ESP doesn't protect any IP header fields\nunless those fields are encapsulated by ESP (tunnel mode).\n\nThe following were incorrect answers for this question:\n\nIntegrity and authentication for IP datagrams are provided by AH This is correct, AH provides integrity and authentication and ESP provides integrity,\nauthentication and encryption.\n\nESP provides for integrity, authentication and encryption to IP datagram's. ESP provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality, which protect against data\ntampering and, most importantly, provide message content protection.\n\nIn transport mode, ESP only encrypts the data payload of each packet. ESP can be operated in either tunnel mode (where the original packet is encapsulated into\na new one) or transport mode (where only the data payload of each packet is encrypted, leaving the header untouched).

In object-relational\ndatabases, the approach is essentially that of relational databases: the data resides in the database and is manipulated collectively with queries in a query\nlanguage; at the other extreme are OODBMSes in which the database is essentially a persistent object store\n\nfor software written in an object-oriented programming language, with a programming API for storing and retrieving objects, and little or no specific support for\nquerying.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\nHierarchical database model - In a hierarchical model, data is organized into a tree-like structure, implying a single parent for each record. A sort field keeps\nsibling records in a particular order. Network database model-The network model expands upon the hierarchical structure, allowing many-to-many relationships in\na tree-like structure that allows multiple parents. Object-relational database models- An object-relational database can be said to provide a middle ground between\nrelational databases and object-oriented databases (OODBMS). In object-relational databases, the approach is essentially that of relational databases: the data\nresides in the database and is manipulated collectively with queries in a query language; at the other extreme are OODBMSes in which the database is essentially\na persistent object store for software written in an object-oriented programming language, with a programming API for storing and retrieving objects, and little or no\nspecific support for querying.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 254",

High-interaction honey pots imitate the activities of the production systems that\n\fhost a variety of services and, therefore, an attacker may be allowed a lot of services to waste his time. According to recent research into high-interaction honey\npot technology, by employing virtual machines, multiple honey pots can be hosted on a single physical machine. Therefore, even if the honey pot is compromised,\nit can be restored more quickly. In general, high-interaction honey pots provide more security by being difficult to detect, but they are highly expensive to maintain.\nIf virtual machines are not available, one honey pot must be maintained for each physical computer, which can be exorbitantly expensive. Example: Honey net.\n\nLow interaction Emulate production environment and therefore, provide more limited information. Low- interaction honey pots simulate only the services frequently\nrequested by attackers. Since they consume relatively few resources, multiple virtual machines can easily be hosted on one physical system, the virtual systems\nhave a short response time, and less code is required, reducing the complexity of the virtual system's security. Example: Honeyed.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nBastion host - On the Internet, a bastion host is the only host computer that a company allows to be addressed directly from the public network and that is\ndesigned to screen the rest of its network from security exposure. DMZ or Demilitarize Zone In computer networks, a DMZ (demilitarized zone) is a computer host\nor small network inserted as a \"neutral zone\" between a company's private network and the outside public network. It prevents outside users from getting direct\naccess to a server that has company data. Dual Homed - Dual- homed or dual-homing can refer to either an Ethernet device that has more than one network\ninterface, for redundancy purposes, or in firewall technology, dual-homed is one of the firewall architectures for implementing preventive security.\n\nDual-Homed - An example of dual-homed devices are enthusiast computing motherboards that incorporate dual Ethernet network interface cards or a firewall with\ntwo network interface cards.

    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nThere are two basic techniques for encrypting information: symmetric encryption (also called secret key encryption) and asymmetric encryption (also called public\nkey encryption.)\n\nSymmetric Encryption\nSymmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random letters, is applied to the text\nof a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the alphabet. As long as both\nsender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key. Few examples of symmetric key algorithms are DES, AES,\nBlowfish, etc\n\nAsymmetric Encryption\nThe problem with secret keys is exchanging them over the Internet or a large network while preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. Anyone who knows\nthe secret key can decrypt the message. One answer is the usage of asymmetric encryption, in which there are two related keys, usually called a key pair. The\npublic key is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. The second key, called the private key is kept secret, so that only you know\nit.\n\nAny message (text, binary files, or documents) that are encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted by the matching private key. Any message that is\nencrypted by using the private key can only be decrypted by using the matching public key.\n\nThis means that you do not have to worry about passing public keys over the Internet (the keys are supposed to be public).A problem with asymmetric encryption,\nhowever, is that it is slower than symmetric encryption. It requires far more processing power to both encrypt and decrypt the content of the message.\n\nFew examples of asymmetric key algorithms are RSA, Elliptic key Cryptography (ECC), El Gamal, Differ- Hellman, etc\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nThe other options don't describe correctly the difference between symmetric key and asymmetric key encryption.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 348 and 349\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/246071",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nThe digital signature is used to achieve integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation. In a digital signature, the sender's private key is used to encrypt the message\ndigest of the message. Encrypting the message digest is the act of Signing the message. The receiver will use the matching public key of the sender to decrypt the\nDigital Signature using the sender's public key.\n\nA digital signature (not to be confused with a digital certificate) is an electronic signature that can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message\nor the signer of a document, and possibly to ensure that\n\nthe original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged. Digital signatures cannot be forged by someone else who does not possess the\nprivate key, it can also be automatically time-stamped. The ability to ensure that the original signed message arrived means that the sender cannot easily\nrepudiate it later.\n\nA digital signature can be used with any kind of message, whether it is encrypted or not, simply so that the receiver can be sure of the sender's identity and that\nthe message arrived intact. A digital certificate contains the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that anyone can verify that the certificate is real\nand has not been modified since the day it was issued.\n\nHow Digital Signature Works\nAssume you were going to send the draft of a contract to your lawyer in another town. You want to give your lawyer the assurance that it was unchanged from\nwhat you sent and that it is really from you.\n\nYou copy-and-paste the contract (it's a short one!) into an e-mail note. Using special software, you obtain a message hash (mathematical summary) of the\ncontract. You then use a private key that you have previously obtained from a public-private key authority to encrypt the hash.\nThe encrypted hash becomes your digital signature of the message. (Note that it will be different each time you send a message.)\n\nAt the other end, your lawyer receives the message.\nTo make sure it's intact and from you, your lawyer makes a hash of the received message. Your lawyer then uses your public key to decrypt the message hash or\nsummary.\nIf the hashes match, the received message is valid.\n\nBelow are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:\n\nAuthentication\nAlthough messages may often include information about the entity sending a message, that information may not be accurate. Digital signatures can be used to\nauthenticate the source of messages. The importance of high assurance in the sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example,\nsuppose a bank's branch office sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that\nsuch a message is truly sent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a serious mistake.\n\nIntegrity\nIn many scenarios, the sender and receiver of a message may have a need for confidence that the message has not been altered during transmission. Although\nencryption hides the contents of a message, it may be possible to change an encrypted message without understanding it.(Some encryption algorithms, known as\nnonmalleable ones, prevent this, but others do not.) However, if a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after the signature has been applied\nwould invalidates the signature. Furthermore, there is no efficient way to modify a message and its signature to produce a new message with a valid signature,\nbecause this is still considered to be computationally infeasible by most cryptographic hash functions (see collision resistance).\n\nNon-repudiation\nNon-repudiation, or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some\ninformation cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.\n\nNote that authentication, non-repudiation, and other properties rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is\n\fa required ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an \"online\" check,\ne.g. checking a \"Certificate Revocation List\" or via the \"Online Certificate Status Protocol\". This is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first checking\nonline with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen.\n\nTip for the exam\nDigital Signature does not provide confidentiality. It provides only authenticity and integrity. The sender's private key is used to encrypt the message digest to\ncalculate the digital signature\n\nEncryption provides only confidentiality. The receiver's public key or symmetric key is used for encryption\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nEncrypt the message digest using symmetric key and then send the encrypted digest to receiver along with original message - Symmetric key encryption does not\nprovide non-repudiation as symmetric key is shared between users\n\nEncrypt the message digest using receiver's public key and then send the encrypted digest to receiver along with original message. The receiver can decrypt the\nmessage digest using his own private key - Receiver's public key is known to everyone. This will not address non-repudiation\n\nEncrypt the message digest using sender's public key and then send the encrypted digest to the receiver along with original message. The receiver can decrypt\nusing his own private key -The sender public key is known to everyone. If sender's key is used for encryption, then sender's private key is required to decrypt data.\nThe receiver will not be able to decrypt the digest as receiver will not have sender's private key.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 331\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Digital_Signature_diagram.svg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\nhttp://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature",

The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization\n(ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.\n\nThe model groups communication functions into seven logical layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer\nthat provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive\npackets that make up the contents of that path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal.\nOSI Model\n\fPHYSICAL LAYER\nThe physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model, is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.\nIt describes the electrical/optical, mechanical, and functional interfaces to the physical medium, and carries the signals for all of the higher layers. It provides:\n\nData encoding: modifies the simple digital signal pattern (1s and 0s) used by the PC to better accommodate the characteristics of the physical medium, and to aid\nin bit and frame synchronization. It determines:\nWhat signal state represents a binary 1\nHow the receiving station knows when a \"bit-time\" starts\nHow the receiving station delimits a frame\n\nDATA LINK LAYER\nThe data link layer provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer, allowing layers above it to assume virtually error-\nfree transmission over the link. To do this, the data link layer provides:\n\nLink establishment and termination: establishes and terminates the logical link between two nodes. Frame traffic control: tells the transmitting node to \"back-off\"\nwhen no frame buffers are available.\nFrame sequencing: transmits/receives frames sequentially.\nFrame acknowledgment: provides/expects frame acknowledgments. Detects and recovers from errors that occur in the physical layer by retransmitting non-\nacknowledged frames and handling duplicate frame receipt.\nFrame delimiting: creates and recognizes frame boundaries.\nFrame error checking: checks received frames for integrity.\nMedia access management: determines when the node \"has the right\" to use the physical medium.\n\nNETWORK LAYER\nThe network layer controls the operation of the subnet, deciding which physical path the data should take based on network conditions, priority of service, and\nother factors. It provides:\nRouting: routes frames among networks.\nSubnet traffic control: routers (network layer intermediate systems) can instruct a sending station to \"throttle back\" its frame transmission when the router's buffer\nfills up. Frame fragmentation: if it determines that a downstream router's maximum transmission unit (MTU) size is less than the frame size, a router can fragment\na frame for transmission and re-assembly at the destination station.\nLogical-physical address mapping: translates logical addresses, or names, into physical addresses. Subnet usage accounting: has accounting functions to keep\ntrack of frames forwarded by subnet intermediate systems, to produce billing information.\n\nCommunications Subnet\nThe network layer software must build headers so that the network layer software residing in the subnet intermediate systems can recognize them and use them to\nroute data to the destination address.\n\nThis layer relieves the upper layers of the need to know anything about the data transmission and intermediate\n\nswitching technologies used to connect systems. It establishes, maintains and terminates connections across the intervening communications facility (one or\nseveral intermediate systems in the communication subnet).\n\nIn the network layer and the layers below, peer protocols exist between a node and its immediate neighbor, but the neighbor may be a node through which data is\n\frouted, not the destination station. The source and destination stations may be separated by many intermediate systems.\n\nTRANSPORT LAYER\nThe transport layer ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications. It relieves the higher layer protocols from any\nconcern with the transfer of data between them and their peers.\n\nThe size and complexity of a transport protocol depends on the type of service it can get from the network layer. For a reliable network layer with virtual circuit\ncapability, a minimal transport layer is required. If the network layer is unreliable and/or only supports datagram's, the transport protocol should include extensive\nerror detection and recovery.\n\nThe transport layer provides:\nMessage segmentation: accepts a message from the (session) layer above it, splits the message into smaller units (if not already small enough), and passes the\nsmaller units down to the network layer. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.\nMessage acknowledgment: provides reliable end-to-end message delivery with acknowledgments. Message traffic control: tells the transmitting station to \"back-\noff\" when no message buffers are available. Session multiplexing: multiplexes several message streams, or sessions onto one logical link and keeps track of\nwhich messages belong to which sessions (see session layer).\n\nTypically, the transport layer can accept relatively large messages, but there are strict message size limits imposed by the network (or lower) layer. Consequently,\nthe transport layer must break up the messages into smaller units, or frames, pretending a header to each frame.\n\nThe transport layer header information must then include control information, such as message start and message end flags, to enable the transport layer on the\nother end to recognize message boundaries. In addition, if the lower layers do not maintain sequence, the transport header must contain sequence information to\nenable the transport layer on the receiving end to get the pieces back together in the right order before handing the received message up to the layer above.\n\nEnd-to-end layers\nUnlike the lower \"subnet\" layers whose protocol is between immediately adjacent nodes, the transport layer and the layers above are true \"source to destination\"\nor end-to-end layers, and are not concerned with the details of the underlying communications facility. Transport layer software (and software above it) on the\nsource station carries on a conversation with similar software on the destination station by using message headers and control messages.\n\nSESSION LAYER\nThe session layer allows session establishment between processes running on different stations. It provides:\nSession establishment, maintenance and termination: allows two application processes on different machines to establish, use and terminate a connection, called\na session. Session support: performs the functions that allow these processes to communicate over the network, performing security, name recognition, logging,\nand so on.\n\nPRESENTATION LAYER\nThe presentation layer formats the data to be presented to the application layer. It can be viewed as the translator for the network. This layer may translate data\nfrom a format used by the application layer into a common format at the sending station, then translate the common format to a format known to the application\nlayer at the receiving station.\n\nThe presentation layer provides:\nCharacter code translation: for example, ASCII to EBCDIC.\nData conversion: bit order, CR-CR/LF, integer-floating point, and so on.\n\nData compression: reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nThe sender private key is used to calculate the digital signature\n\nThe digital signature is used to achieve integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation. In a digital signature, the sender's private key is used to encrypt the message\ndigest (signing) of the message and receiver need to decrypt the same using sender's public key to validate the signature.\n\nA digital signature (not to be confused with a digital certificate) is an electronic signature that can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message\nor the signer of a document, and possibly to ensure that the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged. Digital signatures are\neasily transportable, cannot be imitated by someone else, and can be automatically time-stamped. The ability to ensure that the original signed message arrived\nmeans that the sender cannot easily repudiate it later.\n\nA digital signature can be used with any kind of message, whether it is encrypted or not, simply so that the receiver can be sure of the sender's identity and that\nthe message arrived intact. A digital certificate contains the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that anyone can verify that the certificate is real.\nHow It Works\nAssume you were going to send the draft of a contract to your lawyer in another town. You want to give your lawyer the assurance that it was unchanged from\nwhat you sent and that it is really from you.\n\fYou copy-and-paste the contract (it's a short one!) into an e-mail note. Using special software, you obtain a message hash (mathematical summary) of the\ncontract. You then use a private key that you have previously obtained from a public-private key authority to encrypt the hash.\nThe encrypted hash becomes your digital signature of the message. (Note that it will be different each time you send a message.)\n\nAt the other end, your lawyer receives the message:\n\nTo make sure it's intact and from you, your lawyer makes a hash of the received message. Your lawyer then uses your public key to decrypt the message hash or\nsummary.\nIf the hashes match, the received message is valid.\n\nBelow are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:\n\nAuthentication\nAlthough messages may often include information about the entity sending a message, that information may not be accurate. Digital signatures can be used to\nauthenticate the source of messages. When ownership of a digital signature secret key is bound to a specific user, a valid signature shows that the message was\nsent by that user. The importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose a bank's branch\noffice sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account. If the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly\nsent from an authorized source, acting on such a request could be a grave mistake.\nIntegrity\nIn many scenarios, the sender and receiver of a message may have a need for confidence that the message has not been altered during transmission. Although\nencryption hides the contents of a message, it may be possible to change an encrypted message without understanding it. (Some encryption algorithms, known as\nnonmalleable ones, prevent this, but others do not.) However, if a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after signature invalidates the signature.\nFurthermore, there is no efficient way to modify a message and its signature to produce a new message with a valid signature, because this is still considered to\nbe computationally infeasible by most cryptographic hash functions (see collision resistance).\nNon-repudiation\nNon-repudiation, or more specifically non-repudiation of origin, is an important aspect of digital signatures. By this property, an entity that has signed some\ninformation cannot at a later time deny having signed it. Similarly, access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature.\n\nNote that these authentication, non-repudiation etc. properties rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to its usage. Public revocation of a key-pair is a\nrequired ability, else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key-pair. Checking revocation status requires an \"online\" check, e.g.\nchecking a \"Certificate Revocation List\" or via the \"Online Certificate Status Protocol\". Very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit-cards first\nchecking online with the credit-card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen. Of course, with stolen key pairs, the theft is often discovered only\nafter the secret key's use, e.g., to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purposes.\n\nTip for the exam:\n\nDigital Signature does not provide confidentiality. The sender's private key is used for calculating digital signature\nEncryption provides only confidentiality. The receiver's public key or symmetric key is used for encryption\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nSender's Public key This is incorrect as receiver will require sender's private key to verify digital signature. Receiver's Public Key The digital signature provides\nnon-repudiation. The receiver's public key is known to every one. So it can not be used for digital-signature. Receiver's public key can be used for encryption.\nReceiver's Private Key The sender does not know the receiver's private key. So this option is incorrect.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 348\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Digital_Signature_diagram.svg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\nhttp://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature",

It provides:\nRouting: routes frames among networks.\nSubnet traffic control: routers (network layer intermediate systems) can instruct a sending station to \"throttle back\" its frame transmission when the router's buffer\nfills up.

It\nestablishes, maintains and terminates connections across the intervening communications facility (one or several intermediate systems in the communication\nsubnet).\n\nIn the network layer and the layers below, peer protocols exist between a node and its immediate neighbor, but the neighbor may be a node through which data is\nrouted, not the destination station. The source and destination stations may be separated by many intermediate systems.\n\nTRANSPORT LAYER\nThe transport layer ensures that messages are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications.

Consequently,\nthe transport layer must break up the messages into smaller units, or frames, pretending a header to each frame.\n\nThe transport layer header information must then include control information, such as message start and message end flags, to enable the transport layer on the\nother end to recognize message boundaries. In addition, if the lower layers do not maintain sequence, the transport header must contain sequence information to\nenable the transport layer on the receiving end to get the pieces back together in the right order before handing the received message up to the layer above.\n\nEnd-to-end layers\nUnlike the lower \"subnet\" layers whose protocol is between immediately adjacent nodes, the transport layer and the layers above are true \"source to destination\"\nor end-to-end layers, and are not concerned with the details of the underlying communications facility.

This layer may translate data\nfrom a format used by the application layer into a common format at the sending station, then translate the common format to a format known to the application\nlayer at the receiving station.\n\nThe presentation layer provides:\nCharacter code translation: for example, ASCII to EBCDIC.\nData conversion: bit order, CR-CR/LF, integer-floating point, and so on.

Initial commercial usage has already\nstarted now that the laboratory research phase has been completed.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers: Elliptic Key Cryptography(ECC) - A variant and more efficient form of a public key cryptography (how to manage more\nsecurity out of minimum resources) gaining prominence is the ECC. ECC works well on a network computer requires strong cryptography but have some limitation\nsuch as bandwidth and processing power. This is even more important with devices such as smart cards, wireless phones and other mobile devices. It is believed\nthat ECC demands less computational power and, therefore offers more security per bit. For example, an ECC with a 160-bit key offer the same security as an\nRSA based system with a 1024-bit key.\n\nSymmetric Encryption- Symmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random\nletters, is applied to the text of a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the\nalphabet. As long as both sender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key.\n\nThe problem with secret keys is exchanging them over the Internet or a large network while preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. Anyone who knows\nthe secret key can decrypt the message.\n\nAsymmetric encryption -In which there are two related keys--a key pair. A public key is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. A\nsecond, private key is kept secret, so that only you know it.\n\nAny message (text, binary files, or documents) that are encrypted by using the public key can only be decrypted by applying the same algorithm, but by using the\nmatching private key. Any message that is encrypted by using the private key can only be decrypted by using the matching public key.\n\nThis means that you do not have to worry about passing public keys over the Internet (the keys are supposed to be public). A problem with asymmetric encryption,\n\fhowever, is that it is slower than symmetric encryption. It requires far more processing power to both encrypt and decrypt the content of the message.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 349 and 350\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/246071",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nECC demands less computational power and, therefore offers more security per bit. For example, an ECC with a 160-bit key offer the same security as an RSA\nbased system with a 1024-bit key.\n\nECC is a variant and more efficient form of a public key cryptography (how tom manage more security out of minimum resources) gaining prominence is the ECC.\nECC works well on a network computer requires strong cryptography but have some limitation such as bandwidth and processing power. This is even more\nimportant with devices such as smart cards, wireless phones and other mobile devices.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nQuantum Cryptography - Quantum cryptography is based on a practical application of the characteristics of the smallest \"grain\" of light, photons and on physical\nlaws governing their generation, propagation and detection. Quantum cryptography is the next generation of cryptography that may solve some of the existing\nproblem associated with current cryptographic systems, specifically the random generation and secure distribution of symmetric cryptographic keys. Initial\ncommercial usage has already started now that the laboratory research phase has been completed.\n\nSymmetric Encryption - Symmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random\nletters, is applied to the text of a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the\nalphabet. As long as both sender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key.\n\nAsymmetric Encryption - The problem with secret keys is exchanging them over the Internet or a large network while preventing them from falling into the wrong\nhands. Anyone who knows the secret key can decrypt the message. One answer is asymmetric encryption, in which there are two related keys--a key pair. A\npublic key is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. A second, private key is kept secret, so that only you know it. Any message\n(text, binary files, or documents) that are encrypted by using the public key can only be decrypted by applying the same algorithm, but by using the matching\nprivate key. Any message that is encrypted by using the private key can only be decrypted by using the matching public key. This means that you do not have to\nworry about passing public keys over the Internet (the keys are supposed to be public). A problem with asymmetric encryption, however, is that it is slower than\nsymmetric encryption. It requires far more processing power to both encrypt and decrypt the content of the message.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 349 and 350\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/246071",

It is a secure method to send electronic\ndocument without compromising the data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation, which were obtained with the use of symmetric keys.\n\nA Digital envelope mechanism works as follows:\n\nThe symmetric key, which is used to encrypt the bulk of the date or message can be referred to as session key. It is simply a symmetric key picked randomly in the\nkey space. In order for the receiver to have the ability to decrypt the message, the session key must be sent to the receiver.\nThis session key cannot be sent in clear text to the receiver, it must be protected while in transit, else anyone who have access to the network could have access\nto the key and confidentiality can easily be compromised. Therefore, it is critical to encrypt and protect the session key before sending it to the receiver. The\nsession key is encrypted using receiver's public key. Thus providing confidentiality of the key. The encrypted message and the encrypted session key are bundled\ntogether and then sent to the receiver who, in turn opens the session key with the receiver matching private key. The session key is then applied to the message\nto get it in plain text.\n\nThe process of encrypting bulk data using symmetric key cryptography and encrypting the session key with a public key algorithm is referred as a digital envelope.\nSometimes people refer to it as Hybrid Cryptography as well.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nDigital-signature A digital signature is an electronic identification of a person or entity created by using public key algorithm and intended to verify to recipient the\nintegrity of the data and the identity of the sender. Applying a digital signature consist of two simple steps, first you create a message digest, then you encrypt the\nmessage digest with the sender's private key. Encrypting the message digest with the private key is the act of signing the message.\n\nSymmetric Key Encryption - Symmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random\nletters, is applied to the text of a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the\nalphabet. As long as both sender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key.\n\nAsymmetric Key Encryption - The term \"asymmetric\" stems from the use of different keys to perform these opposite functions, each the inverse of the other as\ncontrasted with conventional (\"symmetric\") cryptography which relies on the same key to perform both. Public-key algorithms are based on mathematical problems\nwhich currently admit no efficient solution that are inherent in certain integer factorization, discrete logarithm, and elliptic curve relationships. It is computationally\neasy for a user to generate their own public and private key-pair and to use them for encryption and decryption. The strength lies in the fact that it is\n\"impossible\" (computationally unfeasible) for a properly generated private key to be determined from its corresponding public key. Thus the public key may be\npublished without compromising security, whereas the\n\fprivate key must not be revealed to anyone not authorized to read messages or perform digital signatures. Public key algorithms, unlike symmetric key algorithms,\ndo not require a secure initial exchange of one (or more) secret keys between the parties.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 350 and 351\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography",

The device amplifies signals because\nsignals attenuate the farther they have to travel.\n\nRepeaters can also work as line conditioners by actually cleaning up the signals. This works much better when amplifying digital signals than when amplifying\nanalog signals, because digital signals are discrete units, which makes extraction of background noise from them much easier for the amplifier. If the device is\namplifying analog signals, any accompanying noise often is amplified as well, which may further distort the signal. A hub is a multi-port repeater. A hub is often\nreferred to as a concentrator because it is the physical communication device that allows several computers and devices to communicate with each other. A hub\ndoes not understand or work with IP or MAC addresses. When one system sends a signal to go to another system connected to it, the signal is broadcast to all the\nports, and thus to all the systems connected to the concentrator.\n\nRepeater\n\n\n\n\nBridges\nA bridge is a LAN device used to connect LAN segments. It works at the data link layer and therefore works with MAC addresses. A repeater does not work with\naddresses; it just forwards all signals it receives. When a frame arrives at a bridge, the bridge determines whether or not the MAC address is on the local network\nsegment. If the MAC address is not on the local network segment, the bridge forwards the frame to the necessary network segment.\n\nBridge\n\fRouters\nRouters are layer 3, or network layer, devices that are used to connect similar or different networks. (For example, they can connect two Ethernet LANs or an\nEthernet LAN to a Token Ring LAN.) A router is a device that has two or more interfaces and a routing table so it knows how to get packets to their destinations. It\ncan filter traffic based on access control lists (ACLs), and it fragments packets when necessary. Because routers have more network-level knowledge, they can\nperform higher-level functions, such as calculating the shortest and most economical path between the sending and receiving hosts.\n\nRouter and Switch\n\n\n\n\nSwitches\nSwitches combine the functionality of a repeater and the functionality of a bridge. A switch amplifies the electrical signal, like a repeater, and has the built-in\ncircuitry and intelligence of a bridge. It is a multi-port connection device that provides connections for individual computers or other hubs and switches.\n\nGateways\nGateway is a general term for software running on a device that connects two different environments and that many times acts as a translator for them or\nsomehow restricts their interactions.\n\nUsually a gateway is needed when one environment speaks a different language, meaning it uses a certain protocol that the other environment does not\nunderstand. The gateway can translate Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol packets to IP packets, accept mail from one type of mail server and format it\nso another type of mail server can accept and understand it, or connect and translate different data link technologies such as FDDI to Ethernet.\n\nGateway Server\n\fThe following were incorrect answers:\nThe other options presented correctly describes about Router.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 263",

We need to find out the invalid statement from the options.\n\nA PKI (public key infrastructure) enables users of a basically unsecure public network such as the Internet to securely and privately exchange data and money\nthrough the use of a public and a private cryptographic key pair that is obtained and shared through a trusted authority. The public key infrastructure provides for a\ndigital certificate that can identify an individual or an organization and directory services that can store and, when necessary, revoke the certificates. Although the\ncomponents of a PKI are generally understood, a number of different vendor approaches and services are emerging. Meanwhile, an Internet standard for PKI is\nbeing worked on.\n\nThe public key infrastructure assumes the use of public key cryptography, which is the most common method on the Internet for authenticating a message sender\nor encrypting a message. Traditional cryptography has usually involved the creation and sharing of a secret key for the encryption and decryption of messages.\nThis secret or private key system has the significant flaw that if the key is discovered or intercepted by someone else, messages can easily be decrypted. For this\nreason, public key cryptography and the public key infrastructure is the preferred approach on the Internet. (The private key system is sometimes known as\nsymmetric cryptography and the public key system as asymmetric cryptography.)\n\nA public key infrastructure consists of:\n\nA certificate authority (CA) that issues and verifies digital certificate.

Each computer or server is connected to the single bus cable. A\nsignal from the source travels in both directions to all machines connected on the bus cable until it finds the intended recipient. If the machine address does not\nmatch the intended address for the data, the machine ignores the data. Alternatively, if the data matches the machine address, the data is accepted. Since the bus\ntopology consists of only one wire, it is rather inexpensive to implement when compared to other topologies. However, the low cost of implementing the technology\nis offset by the high cost of managing the network. Additionally, since only one cable is utilized, it can be the single point of failure. If the network cable is\nterminated on both ends and when without termination data transfer stop and when cable breaks, the entire network will be down.\nBus topology\n\n\n\n\nLinear bus\nThe type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has exactly two endpoints (this is\nthe 'bus', which is also commonly referred to as the backbone, or trunk) all data that is transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this common\ntransmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.\n\nDistributed bus\nThe type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has more than two endpoints that\nare created by adding branches to the main section of the transmission medium the physical distributed bus topology functions in exactly the same fashion as the\nphysical linear bus topology (i.e., all nodes share a common transmission medium).\n\nStar\nIn local area networks with a star topology, each network host is connected to a central point with a point-to- point connection.

However, the low cost of implementing the technology\nis offset by the high cost of managing the network. Additionally, since only one cable is utilized, it can be the single point of failure. If the network cable is\nterminated on both ends and when without termination data transfer stop and when cable breaks, the entire network will be down.\nBus topology\n\fLinear bus\nThe type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has exactly two endpoints (this is\nthe 'bus', which is also commonly referred to as the backbone, or trunk) all data that is transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this common\ntransmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.\n\nDistributed bus\nThe type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has more than two endpoints that\nare created by adding branches to the main section of the transmission medium the physical distributed bus topology functions in exactly the same fashion as the\nphysical linear bus topology (i.e., all nodes share a common transmission medium).\n\nStar\n\nIn local area networks with a star topology, each network host is connected to a central point with a point-to- point connection. In Star topology every node\n(computer workstation or any other peripheral) is connected to central node called hub or switch.\n\nThe switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients. The network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network, but all of\nthe nodes on the network must be connected to one central device.\n\nAll traffic that traverses the network passes through the central point. The central point acts as a signal repeater.\n\nThe star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement. An advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional nodes. The\nprimary disadvantage of the star topology is that the central point represents a single point of failure.\nStar Topology\n\fRing\n\nA network topology that is set up in a circular fashion in which data travels around the ring in one direction and each device on the ring acts as a repeater to keep\nthe signal strong as it travels. Each device incorporates a receiver for the incoming signal and a transmitter to send the data on to the next device in the ring.\n\nThe network is dependent on the ability of the signal to travel around the ring. When a device sends data, it must travel through each device on the ring until it\nreaches its destination. Every node is a critical link. If one node goes down the whole link would be affected.\n\nRing Topology\n\fMesh\n\nThe value of a fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers, assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints, up\nto and including all the endpoints, is approximated by Reed's Law.\nA mesh network provides for high availability and redundancy. However, the cost of such network could be very expensive if dozens of devices are in the mesh.\nMesh Topology\n\fFully connected mesh topology\nA fully connected network is a communication network in which each of the nodes is connected to each other. In graph theory it known as a complete graph. A\nfully connected network doesn't need to use switching nor broadcasting. However, its major disadvantage is that the number of connections grows quadratic ally\nwith the number of nodes, so it is extremely impractical for large networks. A two-node network is technically a fully connected network.\n\nPartially connected mesh topology\nThe type of network topology in which some of the nodes of the network are connected to more than one other node in the network with a point-to-point link this\nmakes it possible to take advantage of some of the redundancy that is provided by a physical fully connected mesh topology without the expense and complexity\nrequired for a connection between every node in the network.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe other options presented are not valid.\nCISA review manual 2014, Page number 262",

For example, your Internet server provider may provide you with a PPP connection so that the provider's server can respond to your requests,\npass them on to the Internet, and forward your requested Internet responses back to you. PPP uses the Internet protocol (IP) (and is designed to handle others). It\nis sometimes considered a member of the TCP/IP suite of protocols. Relative to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, PPP provides layer 2\n(data-link layer) service. Essentially, it packages your computer's TCP/IP packets and forwards them to the server where they can actually be put on the Internet.\n\nPPP is a full-duplex protocol that can be used on various physical media, including twisted pair or fiber optic lines or satellite transmission. It uses a variation of\nHigh Speed Data Link Control (HDLC) for packet encapsulation.\n\nPPP is usually preferred over the earlier de facto standard Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) because it can handle synchronous as well as asynchronous\ncommunication.

MPLS is called multiprotocol because it works with the Internet Protocol (IP), Asynchronous Transport Mode (ATM), and\nframe relay network protocols. With reference to the standard model for a network (the Open Systems Interconnection, or OSI model), MPLS allows most packets\nto be forwarded at the Layer 2 (switching) level rather than at the Layer 3 (routing) level.

Scanners Look for sequences of bit called signature that are typical malware programs.\n\nThe two primary types of scanner are\n\n1. Malware mask or Signatures Anti-malware scanners check files, sectors and system memory for known and new (unknown to scanner) malware, on the basis\nof malware masks or signatures. Malware masks or signature are specific code strings that are recognized as belonging to malware. For polymorphic malware, the\nscanner sometimes has algorithms that check for all possible combinations of a signature that could exist in an infected file.\n\n2. Heuristic Scanner Analyzes the instructions in the code being scanned and decide on the basis of statistical probabilities whether it could contain malicious\ncode. Heuristic scanning result could indicate that malware may be present, that is possibly infected. Heuristic scanner tend to generate a high level false positive\nerrors (they indicate that malware may be present when, in fact, no malware is present). Scanners examines memory disk- boot sector, executables, data files,\nand command files for bit pattern that match a known malware. Scanners, therefore, need to be updated periodically to remain effective.\n\nB. Immunizers Defend against malware by appending sections of themselves to files sometime in the same way Malware append themselves. Immunizers\ncontinuously check a file for changes and report changes as possible malware behavior. Other types of Immunizers are focused to a specific malware and work by\ngiving the malware the impression that the malware has already infected to the computer. This method is not always practical since it is not possible to immunize\nfile against all known malware.\n\nC. Behavior Blocker Focus on detecting potential abnormal behavior such as writing to the boot sector or the master boot record, or making changes to\nexecutable files. Blockers can potentially detect malware at an early stage. Most hardware based anti-malware mechanism are based on this concept.\n\nD. Integrity CRC checker Compute a binary number on a known malware free program that is then stored in a database file. The number is called Cyclic\nRedundancy Check (CRC). On subsequent scans, when that program is called to execute, it checks for changes to the file as compare to the database and report\npossible\n\ninfection if changes have occurred. A match means no infection; a mismatch means change in the program has occurred. A change in the program could mean\nmalware within it. These scanners are effective in detecting infection; however, they can do so only after infection has occurred. Also, a CRC checker can only\ndetect subsequent changes to files, because they assume files are malware free in the first place. Therefore, they are ineffective against new files that are\nmalware infected and that are not recorded in the database.

Essentially, it packages your computer's TCP/IP packets and forwards them to the server where they can actually be put on the Internet.\n\nPPP is a full-duplex protocol that can be used on various physical media, including twisted pair or fiber optic lines or satellite transmission. It uses a variation of\nHigh Speed Data Link Control (HDLC) for packet\n\nencapsulation.\n\nPPP is usually preferred over the earlier de facto standard Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) because it can handle synchronous as well as asynchronous\ncommunication.

VoIP uses packet switching and not circuit switching.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about VoIP:\n\nVoice-Over-IP\nIP telephony, internet telephony, is the technology that makes it possible to have a voice conversation over the Internet or over any dedicated IP network instead\nof dedicated transmission lines. The protocol is used to carry the signal over the IP network are commonly referred as Voice-Over-IP (VoIP).VoIP is a technology\nwhere voice traffic is carried on top of existing data infrastructure. Sounds are digitalized into IP packets and transferred through the network layer before being\ndecode back into the original voice.\n\nVoIP allows the elimination of circuit switching and the associated waste of bandwidth. Instead, packet switching is used, where IP packets with voice data are\nsent over the network only when data needs to be sent.\n\nIt has advantages over traditional telephony:\n\nUnlike traditional telephony, VoIP innovation progresses at market rates rather than at the rates of multilateral committee process of the International\nTelecommunication Union (ITU)\n\nLower cost per call or even free calls, especially for long distance call\n\nLower infrastructure costs. Once IP infrastructure is installed, no or little additional telephony infrastructure is needed\n\nVoIP Security Issues\nWith the introduction of VoIP, the need for security is more important because it is needed to protect two assets the data and the voice.\n\nProtecting the security of conversation is vital now.\nIn VoIP, packets are sent over the network from the user's computer or VoIP phone to similar equipment at other end. Packets may pass through several\nintermediate systems that are not under the control of the user's ISP.The current Internet architecture does not provide same physical wire security as phone line.\n\nThe main concern of VoIP solution is that while, in the case of traditional telephones, if data system is disrupted, then the different sites of the organization could\nstill be reached via telephone. Thus a backup communication facility should be planned for if the availability of communication is vital to organization. Another\nissue might arise with the fact that IP telephones and their supporting equipment require the same care and maintenance as computer system do.\nTo enhance the protection of the telephone system and data traffic, the VoIP infrastructure should be segregated using Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN).\nIn many cases, session border controllers (SBCs) are utilized to provide security features for VoIP traffic similar to that provided by firewalls.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nLower cost per call or even free calls, especially for long distance call - This is a valid statement about VoIP. In fact it is an advantage of VoIP.\n\nLower infrastructure cost This is a valid statement and advantage of using VoIP as compare to traditional telephony system.\n\nVoIP is a technology where voice traffic is carried on top of existing data infrastructure This is also valid statement about VoIP.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number355",

Many coaxial cables also have an insulating outer sheath or jacket. The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield\nsharing a geometric axis. Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.Coaxial cable\ndiffers from other shielded cable used for carrying lower-frequency signals, such as audio signals, in that the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a\nprecise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a radio frequency transmission line.\n\nCoaxial cable is expensive and does not support many LAN's. It supports data and video.\n\fCoaxial Cable\n\nFiber optics\nAn optical fiber cable is a cable containing one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light. The optical fiber elements are typically individually coated with\nplastic layers and contained in a protective tube suitable for the environment where the cable will be deployed. Different types of cable are used for different\napplications, for example long distance telecommunication, or providing a high-speed data connection between different parts of a building.\n\nFiber optics used for long distance, hard to splice, not vulnerable to cross talk and difficult to tap.

Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying\ncapacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of\nsight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\n\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep\nspace radio communications.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nA Private Branch Exchange(PBX) is a sophisticated computer based switch that can be thought of as essentially a small in-house phone company for the\norganization that operates it. Protection of PBX is thus a height priority. Failure to secure PBX can result in exposing the organization to toll fraud, theft of\nproprietary or confidential information, loss of revenue or legal entanglements. PBX environment involves many security risks, presented by people both internal\nand external to an organization. The threat of the PBX telephone system is many, depending on the goals of these attackers, and include:\n\nTheft of service Toll fraud, probably the most common of motives for attacker.\n\nDisclosure of Information Data disclosed without authorization, either by deliberate actionably accident. Examples includes eavesdropping on conversation and\nunauthorized access to routing and address data.\n\nData Modification Data altered in some meaningful way by recording, deleting or modifying it. For example, an intruder may change billing information or modify\nsystem table to gain additional services.\n\nUnauthorized access Actions that permit an unauthorized user to gain access to system resources or privileges.\n\nDenial of service Actions that prevent the system from functioning in accordance with its intended purpose. A piece of equipment or entity may be rendered\ninoperable or forced to operate in a degraded state; operations that depend on timeliness may be delayed.\n\nTraffic Analysis A form of passive attack in which an intruder observes information about calls and make inferences, e.g. from the source and destination number\nor frequency and length of messages. For example, an intruder observes a high volume of calls between a company's legal department and patent office, and\nconclude that a patent is being filed.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nVirtual Local Area Network A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical group of workstations, servers and network devices that appear to be on the same LAN\ndespite their geographical distribution. A VLAN allows a network of computers and users to communicate in a simulated environment as if they exist in a single\nLAN and are sharing a single broadcast and multicast domain. VLANs are implemented to achieve scalability, security and ease of network management and can\nquickly adapt to change in network requirements and relocation of workstations and server nodes.\n\nVoice over IP VoIP is a technology where voice traffic is carried on top of existing data infrastructure. Sounds are digitalized into IP packets and transferred\nthrough the network layer before being decode back into the original voice.\n\nDial-up connection Dial-up refers to an Internet connection that is established using a modem. The modem connects the computer to standard phone lines, which\nserve as the data transfer medium. When a user initiates a dial-up connection, the modem dials a phone number of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that is\ndesignated to receive dial-up calls. The ISP then establishes the connection, which usually takes about ten seconds and is accompanied by several beeping an\nbuzzing sounds.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 356",

This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each\nother, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying\ncapacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it.

The information in the waves can\nbe extracted and transformed back into its original form.\n\nFiber Optics\n\fMicrowave radio system\nMicrowave transmission refers to the technology of transmitting information or energy by the use of radio waves whose wavelengths are conveniently measured in\nsmall numbers of centimeter; these are called microwaves.\nMicrowaves are widely used for point-to-point communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow\nbeams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to use the same frequencies without interfering with each\nother, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large information-carrying\ncapacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth 30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of\nsight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.\n\nMicrowave radio transmission is commonly used in point-to-point communication systems on the surface of the Earth, in satellite communications, and in deep\nspace radio communications. Other parts of the microwave radio band are used for radars, radio navigation systems, sensor systems, and radio astronomy.\n\nMicrowave radio systems are carriers for voice data signal, cheap and easy to tap.\nMicrowave Radio System\n\fSatellite Radio Link\nSatellite radio is a radio service broadcast from satellites primarily to cars, with the signal broadcast nationwide, across a much wider geographical area than\nterrestrial radio stations. It is available by subscription, mostly commercial free, and offers subscribers more stations and a wider variety of programming options\nthan terrestrial radio.\n\nSatellite radio link uses transponder to send information and easy to tap.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nCopper Cable- Copper cable is very simple to install and easy to tap. It is used mostly for short distance and supports voice and data.\n\nSatellite Radio Link - Satellite radio link uses transponder to send information and easy to tap.\n\nCoaxial cable - Coaxial cable are expensive and does not support many LAN's. It supports data and video CISA review manual 2014 page number 265",

Transport Layer\nTransport Layer is the third layer of the four layer TCP/IP model. The position of the Transport layer is between Application layer and Internet layer. The purpose of\nTransport layer is to permit devices on the source and destination hosts to carry on a conversation. Transport layer defines the level of service and status of the\nconnection used when transporting data.\n\nThe main protocols included at Transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n\nLayer 2.

Internet\nlayer pack data into data packets known as IP datagram's, which contain source and destination address (logical address or IP address) information that is used to\nforward the datagram's between hosts and across networks.

Ethernet uses an Access Method called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/\nCollision Detection) to access the media, when Ethernet operates in a shared media. An Access Method determines how a host will place data on the medium.\n\nIN CSMA/CD Access Method, every host has equal access to the medium and can place data on the wire when the wire is free from network traffic. When a host\nwants to place data on the wire, it will check the wire to find whether another host is already using the medium. If there is traffic already in the medium, the host will\n\nwait and if there is no traffic, it will place the data in the medium. But, if two systems place data on the medium at the same instance, they will collide with each\nother, destroying the data. If the data is destroyed during transmission, the data will need to be retransmitted. After collision, each host will wait for a small interval\nof time and again the data will be retransmitted.\n\nProtocol Data Unit (PDU):\n\n\n\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\fThe other options correctly describe about network device functioning based on TCP/IP model CISA review manual 2014 page number 272",

Application layer defines TCP/IP\napplication protocols and how host programs interface with Transport layer services to use the network.\n\nApplication layer includes all the higher-level protocols like DNS (Domain Naming System), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), Telnet, SSH, FTP (File Transfer\nProtocol), TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) , DHCP (Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol), X Windows, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) etc.\n\nLayer 3. Transport Layer\nTransport Layer is the third layer of the four layer TCP/IP model. The position of the Transport layer is between Application layer and Internet layer. The purpose of\nTransport layer is to permit devices on the source and destination hosts to carry on a conversation. Transport layer defines the level of service and status of the\nconnection used when transporting data.\n\nThe main protocols included at Transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\n\nLayer 2. Internet Layer\nInternet Layer is the second layer of the four layer TCP/IP model. The position of Internet layer is between Network Access Layer and Transport layer. Internet\nlayer pack data into data packets known as IP datagram's, which contain source and destination address (logical address or IP address) information that is used to\n\fforward the datagram's between hosts and across networks. The Internet layer is also responsible for routing of IP datagram's.\n\nPacket switching network depends upon a connectionless internetwork layer. This layer is known as Internet layer. Its job is to allow hosts to insert packets into\nany network and have them to deliver independently to the destination. At the destination side data packets may appear in a different order than they were sent. It\nis the job of the higher layers to rearrange them in order to deliver them to proper network applications operating at the Application layer.\n\nThe main protocols included at Internet layer are IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), RARP\n(Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) and IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).\n\nLayer 1. Network Access Layer\nNetwork Access Layer is the first layer of the four layer TCP/IP model. Network Access Layer defines details of how data is physically sent through the network,\nincluding how bits are electrically or optically signaled by hardware devices that interface directly with a network medium, such as coaxial cable, optical fiber, or\ntwisted pair copper wire.\n\nThe protocols included in Network Access Layer are Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay etc.\n\nThe most popular LAN architecture among those listed above is Ethernet. Ethernet uses an Access Method called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/\nCollision Detection) to access the media, when Ethernet operates in a shared media. An Access Method determines how a host will place data on the medium.\n\nIN CSMA/CD Access Method, every host has equal access to the medium and can place data on the wire when the wire is free from network traffic. When a host\nwants to place data on the wire, it will check the wire to find whether another host is already using the medium. If there is traffic already in the medium, the host will\nwait and if there is no traffic, it will place the data in the medium. But, if two systems place data on the medium at the same instance, they will collide with each\nother, destroying the data. If the data is destroyed during transmission, the data will need to be retransmitted. After collision, each host will wait for a small interval\nof time and again the data will be retransmitted.\n\nProtocol Data Unit (PDU):\n\fThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nThe other functionalities described in the options are performed by application layer in TCP/IP model.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 272",

Microsoft Exchange includes an SMTP server and can also be set up to include POP3 support.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information general Internet terminology:\n\nNetwork access point -Internet service providers access internet using net access point. A Network Access Point (NAP) was a public network exchange facility\nwhere Internet service providers (ISPs) connected with one another in peering arrangements. The NAPs were a key component in the transition from the 1990s\nNSFNET era (when many networks were government sponsored and commercial traffic was prohibited) to the commercial Internet providers of today. They were\noften points of considerable Internet congestion.\n\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet.\nInternet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Internet services\ntypically provided by ISPs include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, co-location.\n\nTelnet or Remote Terminal Control Protocol -A terminal emulation program for TCP/IP networks such as the Internet. The Telnet program runs on your computer\nand connects your PC to a server on the network. You can then enter commands through the Telnet program and they will be executed as if you were entering\nthem directly on the server console. This enables you to control the server and communicate with other servers on the network. To start a Telnet session, you\nmust log in to a server by entering a valid username and password.\nTelnet is a common way to remotely control Web servers.\n\nInternet Link- Internet link is a connection between Internet users and the Internet service provider.\n\nSecure Shell or Secure Socket Shell (SSH) - Secure Shell (SSH), sometimes known as Secure Socket Shell, is a UNIX-based command interface and protocol for\nsecurely getting access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to control Web and other kinds of servers remotely. SSH is actually a\nsuite of three utilities - slog in, sash, and scp - that are secure versions of the earlier UNIX utilities, rlogin, rash, and rap. SSH commands are encrypted and secure\nin several ways. Both ends of the client/server connection are authenticated using a digital certificate, and passwords are protected by being encrypted.\n\nDomain Name System (DNS) - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected\nto the Internet or a private network. It associates information from domain names with each of the assigned entities. Most prominently, it translates easily\nmemorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating computer services and devices worldwide. The Domain Name System is an\nessential component of the functionality of the Internet. This article presents a functional description of the Domain Name System.\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) - The File Transfer Protocol or FTP is a client/server application that is used to move files from one system to another. The client\nconnects to the FTP server, authenticates and is given access that the server is configured to permit. FTP servers can also be configured to allow anonymous\naccess by logging in with an email address but no password.

Occasionally, it's expressed as bytes per second (Bps). A modem that works at\n57,600 bps has twice the bandwidth of a modem that works at 28,800 bps. In general, a link with a high bandwidth is one that may be able to carry enough\ninformation to sustain the succession of images in a video presentation.\n\nIt should be remembered that a real communications path usually consists of a succession of links, each with its own bandwidth. If one of these is much slower\nthan the rest, it is said to be a bandwidth bottleneck.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about Network performance:\n\nNetwork performance refers to measurement of service quality of a telecommunications product as seen by the customer.\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of packet-switched network (ATM):\n\nCircuit-switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure\nof how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include noise, echo and so on.\n\nATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time,\nstability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.\n\nThere are many different ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled\ninstead of measured; one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. These diagrams allow the\nnetwork planner to analyze how the network will perform in each state, ensuring that the network will be optimally designed.\n\nThe following measures are often considered important:\n\nBandwidth - Bandwidth is commonly measured in bits/second is the maximum rate that information can be transferred\nThroughput - Throughput is the actual rate that information is transferred Latency - Latency is the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it, this is\nmainly a function of the signals travel time, and processing time at any nodes the information traverses Jitter - Jitter is the variation in the time of arrival at the\nreceiver of the information Error Rate - Error rate is the number of corrupted bits expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total sen\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThroughput - Throughput is the actual rate that information is transferred\n\nLatency - Latency is the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it, this is mainly a function of the signals travel time, and processing time at any\n\fnodes the information traverses\n\nJitter - Jitter is the variation in the time of arrival at the receiver of the information CISA review manual 2014 page number 275",

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nFor CISA exam you should know below information about Fire Suppression Systems\n\nFire Suppression System\nThis system is designed to automatically activate immediately after detection of heat, typically generated by fire. Like smoke detectors, the system will produce an\naudible alarm when activated and be linked to a central guard station that is regularly monitored. The system should also be inspected and tested annually.\nTesting interval should comply with industry and insurance standard and guideline.\n\nBroadly speaking there are two methods for applying an extinguisher agent: total flooding and local application.\n\nTotal Flooding - System working under total flooding application apply an extinguishing agent to a three dimensional enclosed space in order to achieve a\nconcentration of the agent (volume percentage of agent in air) adequate to extinguish the fire. These type of system may be operated automatically by detection\nand related controls or manually by the operation of a system actuator.\n\nLocal Application - System working under a local application principle apply an extinguishing agent directly onto a fire (usually a two dimensional area) or into a\nthree dimensional region immediately surrounding the substance or object on a fire. The main difference between local application and total flooding design is the\nabsence of physical barrier enclosing the fire space in the local application design.\n\nThe medium of fire suppression varies but usually one of the following:\n\nWater based systems are typically referred to as sprinkler system. These systems are effective but are also unpopular because they damage equipment and\nproperty. The system can be dry-pipe or charged (water is always in system piping). A charged system is more reliable but has the disadvantage of exposing the\nfacility to expensive water damage if the pipe leak or break.\n\nDry-pipe sprinkling system do not have water in the pipe until an electronic fire alarm activates the water to send water into system. This is opposed to fully\ncharged water pipe system. Dry-pipe system has the advantage that any failure in the pipe will not result in water leaking into sensitive equipment from above.\nSince water and electricity do not mix these systems must be combined with an automatic switch to shut down the electric supply to the area protected.\n\nHolon system releases pressurize halos gases that removes oxygen from air, thus starving the fire. Holon was popular because it is an inert gas and does not\ndamage and does not damage equipment like water does. Because halos adversely affect the ozone layer, it was banned in Montreal (Canada) protocol 1987,\nwhich stopped Holon production as of 1 January 1994. As a banned gas, all Holon installation are now required by international agreement to be removed. The\nHolon substitute is FM-200, which is the most effective alternative.\n\nFM-220TM: Also called heptafluoropropane, HFC-227 or HFC-227ea(ISO Name)is a colorless odorless gaseous fire suppression agent. It is commonly used as a\ngaseous fire suppression agent.\n\nAragonite is the brand name for a mixture of 50% argon and 50% nitrogen. It is an inert gas used in gaseous fire suppression systems for extinguishing fires where\ndamage to equipment is to be avoided. Although argon is a nontoxic, it does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen and is simple asphyxiate.\n\nCO2 system releases pressurized carbon dioxide gas into the area protected to replace the oxygen required for combustion. Unlike halos and its later\nreplacement, however, CO2 is unable to sustain human life. Therefore, in most of countries it is illegal to for such a system to be set to automatic release if any\nhuman may be in the area. Because of this, these systems are usually discharged manually, introducing an additional delay in combating fire.\n\nThe following were incorrect answers:\n\nThe other presented options do not describe valid difference between total flooding and local application extinguishing agent.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 373 and 374",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Information System Operations, Maintenance and Support Simply said, the time difference in packet inter-arrival time to their destination can be called\njitter. Jitter is specific issue that normally exists in packet switched networks and this phenomenon is usually not causing any communication problems. TCP/IP is\nresponsible for dealing with the jitter impact on communication.\n\nOn the other hand, in VoIP network environment, or better say in any bigger environment today where we use IP phones on our network this can be a bigger\nproblem. When someone is sending VoIP communication at a normal interval (let's say one frame every 10 ms) those packets can stuck somewhere in between\ninside the packet network and not arrive at expected regular peace to the destined station. That's the whole jitter phenomenon all about so we can say that the\nanomaly in tempo with which packet is expected and when it is in reality received is jitter.\njitter\n\n\n\n\nIn this image above, you can notice that the time it takes for packets to be send is not the same as the period in which the will arrive on the receiver side. One of\nthe packets encounters some delay on his way and it is received little later than it was asumed. Here are the jitter buffers entering the story. They will mitigate\npacket delay if required. VoIP packets in networks have very changeable packet inter-arrival intervals because they are usually smaller than normal data packets\nand are therefore more numerous with bigger chance to get some delay along the way.\n\nFor your exam you should know below information about Network performance:\n\nNetwork performance refers to measurement of service quality of a telecommunications product as seen by the customer.\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of packet-switched network (ATM):\n\nCircuit-switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service.

This\nreduces risk of the combination being known by unauthorized people.\n\nA cipher lock, is controlled by a mechanical key pad, typically 5 to 10 digits that when pushed in the right combination the lock will releases and allows entry. The\ndrawback is someone looking over a shoulder can see the combination. However, an electric version of the cipher lock is in production in which a display screen\nwill automatically move the numbers around, so if someone is trying to watch the movement on the screen they will not be able to identify the number indicated\nunless they are standing directly behind the victim.\n\nRemember locking devices are only as good as the wall or door that they are mounted in and if the frame of the door or the door itself can be easily destroyed then\nthe lock will not be effective.

Transaction processing is handled by less powerful computers such as server computers or mainframes.\n\nMainframes\nThe term mainframe computer was created to distinguish the traditional, large, institutional computer intended to service multiple users from the smaller, single\nuser machines. These computers are capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data quickly. Mainframe computers are used in large institutions\nsuch as government, banks and large corporations. They are measured in MIPS (million instructions per second) and respond to up to 100s of millions of users at\na time.\n\nMid-range servers\nMidrange systems are primarily high-end network servers and other types of servers that can handle the large-scale processing of many business applications.\nAlthough not as powerful as mainframe computers, they are less costly to buy, operate, and maintain than mainframe systems and thus meet the computing needs\nof many organizations. Midrange systems have become popular as powerful network servers to help manage large Internet Web sites, corporate intranets and\nextranets, and other networks. Today, midrange systems include servers used in industrial process-control and manufacturing plants and play major roles in\ncomputer- aided manufacturing (CAM). They can also take the form of powerful technical workstations for computer- aided design (CAD) and other computation\nand graphics-intensive applications. Midrange system are also used as front-end servers to assist mainframe computers in telecommunications processing and\nnetwork management.\n\nPersonal computers\nA personal computer (PC) is a general-purpose computer, whose size, capabilities and original sale price makes it useful for individuals, and which is intended to\nbe operated directly by an end-user with no intervening computer operator. This contrasted with the batch processing or time-sharing models which allowed larger,\nmore expensive minicomputer and mainframe systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time. Large data processing systems require a full-time\nstaff to operate efficiently.\n\nLaptop computers\nA laptop is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor, suitable for mobile use.[1] They are also sometimes called notebook computers or\nnotebooks.

Most modern-day laptop computers also have a webcam and a mice (microphone) pre-installed. [citation needed] A laptop can be powered either\nfrom a rechargeable battery, or by mains electricity via an AC adapter. Laptops are a diverse category of devices, and other more specific terms, such as ultra-\nbooks or net books, refer to specialist types of laptop which have been optimized for certain uses. Hardware specifications change vastly between these\nclassifications, forgoing greater and greater degrees of processing power to reduce heat emissions.\n\nSmartphone, tablets and other handheld devices\nA mobile device (also known as a handheld computer or simply handheld) is a small, handheld computing device, typically having a display screen with touch input\nand/or a miniature keyboard. A handheld computing device has an operating system (OS), and can run various types of application software, known as apps. Most\nhandheld devices can also be equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS capabilities that can allow connections to the Internet and other Bluetooth-capable\ndevices, such as an automobile or a microphone headset. A camera or media player feature for video or music files can also be typically found on these devices\nalong with a stable battery power source such as a lithium battery.\n\nEarly pocket-sized devices were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise similar tablet computers. Much like in a personal digital assistant (PDA), the input\nand output of modern mobile devices are often combined into a touch-screen interface.\n\nSmartphone's and PDAs are popular amongst those who wish to use some of the powers of a conventional computer in environments where carrying one would\nnot be practical. Enterprise digital assistants can further extend the available functionality for the business user by offering integrated data capture devices like\nbarcode, RFID and smart card readers.\n\nThin Client computers\nA thin client (sometimes also called a lean, zero or slim client) is a computer or a computer program that depends heavily on some other computer (its server) to\nfulfill its computational roles.

This is commonly\nthought to be unethical and there is an old adage that \"eavesdroppers seldom hear anything good of themselves...eavesdroppers always try to listen to matters\nthat concern them.\"\n\nTraffic analysis - is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even\nwhen the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more\ncan be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is a\nconcern in computer security.\n\nMasquerading - A masquerade attack is an attack that uses a fake identity, such as a network identity, to gain unauthorized access to personal computer\ninformation through legitimate access identification. If an authorization process is not fully protected, it can become extremely vulnerable to a masquerade attack.\nMasquerade attacks can be perpetrated using stolen passwords and logons, by locating gaps in programs, or by finding a way around the authentication process.\nThe attack can be triggered either by someone within the organization or by an outsider if the organization is connected to a public network. The amount of access\nmasquerade attackers get depends on the level of authorization they've managed to attain. As such, masquerade attackers can have a full smorgasbord of cyber\ncrime opportunities if they've gained the highest\n\naccess authority to a business organization. Personal attacks, although less common, can also be harmful.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 322",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nPhishing technique include social engineering, link manipulation or web site forgery techniques.\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nPhishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by\nmasquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online\npayment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with\nmalware. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel\nare almost identical to the legitimate one. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users, and exploits the poor usability of current\nweb security technologies. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and\ntechnical security measures.\n\nSpear phishing - Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. Attackers may gather personal information\nabout their target to increase their probability of success.\n\nLink manipulation\nMost methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear to belong to the\nspoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of sub domains are common tricks used by phishes. In the following example URL, http://\nwww.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will take you to the example section of the your bank website; actually this URL points to the \"your\nbank\" (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the tags) suggest a reliable\ndestination, when the link actually goes to the phishes' site. The following example link, //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Genuine, appears to direct the user to an article\nentitled \"Genuine\"; clicking on it will in fact take the user to the article entitled \"Deception\". In the lower left hand corner of most browsers users can preview and\nverify where the link is going to take them. Hovering your cursor over the link for a couple of seconds may do a similar thing, but this can still be set by the phishes\nthrough the HTML tooltip tag.\n\nWebsite forgery\nOnce a victim visits the phishing website, the deception is not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to alter the address bar. This is done\neither by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.\n\nAn attacker can even use flaws in a trusted website's own scripts against the victim. These types of attacks (known as cross-site scripting) are particularly\nproblematic, because they direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web page, where everything from the web address to the security certificates\nappears correct.\n\nIn reality, the link to the website is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to spot without specialist knowledge.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nSmurf Attack Occurs when mix-configured network device allow packet to be sent to all hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network\n\nTraffic analysis - is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication.

This contrasted with the batch processing or time-sharing models which allowed larger,\nmore expensive minicomputer and mainframe systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time. Large data processing systems require a full-time\nstaff to operate efficiently.\n\nLaptop computers\nA laptop is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor, suitable for mobile use.[1] They are also sometimes called notebook computers or\nnotebooks. Laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, including work, education, and personal multimedia.\n\nA laptop combines the components and inputs as a desktop computer; including display, speakers, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a touchpad), into a\nsingle device. Most modern-day laptop computers also have a webcam and a mice (microphone) pre-installed. [citation needed] A laptop can be powered either\nfrom a rechargeable battery, or by mains electricity via an AC adapter. Laptops are a diverse category of devices, and other more specific terms, such as ultra-\nbooks or net books, refer to specialist types of laptop which have been optimized for certain uses. Hardware specifications change vastly between these\nclassifications, forgoing greater and greater degrees of processing power to reduce heat emissions.\nSmartphone, tablets and other handheld devices\n\nA mobile device (also known as a handheld computer or simply handheld) is a small, handheld computing device, typically having a display screen with touch input\nand/or a miniature keyboard. A handheld computing device has an operating system (OS), and can run various types of application software, known as apps. Most\nhandheld devices can also be equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS capabilities that can allow connections to the Internet and other Bluetooth-capable\ndevices, such as an automobile or a microphone headset. A camera or media player feature for video or music files can also be typically found on these devices\nalong with a stable battery power source such as a lithium battery.\n\nEarly pocket-sized devices were joined in the late 2000s by larger but otherwise similar tablet computers. Much like in a personal digital assistant (PDA), the input\nand output of modern mobile devices are often combined into a touch-screen interface.\n\nSmartphone's and PDAs are popular amongst those who wish to use some of the powers of a conventional computer in environments where carrying one would\nnot be practical. Enterprise digital assistants can further extend the available functionality for the business user by offering integrated data capture devices like\nbarcode, RFID and smart card readers.\n\nThin Client computers\nA thin client (sometimes also called a lean, zero or slim client) is a computer or a computer program that depends heavily on some other computer (its server) to\nfulfill its computational roles. This is different from the traditional fat client, which is a computer designed to take on these roles by itself. The specific roles\nassumed by the server may vary, from providing data persistence (for example, for diskless nodes) to actual information processing on the client's behalf.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe other types of computers are not example of diskless workstation.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 246\n\fhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_computers\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nHarming is a cyber attack intended to redirect a website's traffic to another, bogus site. Harming can be conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim's\ncomputer or by exploitation of a vulnerability in DNS server software. DNS servers are computers responsible for resolving Internet names into their real IP\naddresses. Compromised DNS servers are sometimes referred to as \"poisoned\". Harming requires unprotected access to target a computer, such as altering a\ncustomer's home computer, rather than a corporate business server.\n\nThe term \"phrasing\" is a neologism based on the words \"farming\" and \"phishing\". Phishing is a type of social- engineering attack to obtain access credentials, such\nas user names and passwords. In recent years, both phrasing and phishing have been used to gain information for online identity theft. Phrasing has become of\nmajor concern to businesses hosting ecommerce and online banking websites. Sophisticated measures known as anti-harming are required to protect against this\nserious threat. Antivirus software and spyware removal software cannot protect against harming.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nPhishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by\nmasquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online\npayment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain\n\nlinks to websites that are infected with malware. Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details\nat a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users,\nand exploits the poor usability of current web security technologies. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported phishing incidents include legislation,\nuser training, public awareness, and technical security measures.\n\nSpear phishing - Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. Attackers may gather personal information\nabout their target to increase their probability of success.\n\nLink manipulation\nMost methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear to belong to the\nspoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of sub domains are common tricks used by phishes. In the following example URL, http://\nwww.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will take you to the example section of your bank website; actually this URL points to the \"your\nbank\" (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the are tags) suggest a reliable\ndestination, when the link actually goes to the phishes' site. The following example link, //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Genuine, appears to direct the user to an article\nentitled \"Genuine\"; clicking on it will in fact take the user to the article entitled \"Deception\". In the lower left hand corner of most browsers users can preview and\nverify where the link is going to take them. Hovering your cursor over the link for a couple of seconds may do a similar thing, but this can still be set by the phishes\nthrough the HTML tooltip tag.\nWebsite forgery\nOnce a victim visits the phishing website, the deception is not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to alter the address bar. This is done\neither by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.\n\nAn attacker can even use flaws in a trusted website's own scripts against the victim. These types of attacks (known as cross-site scripting) are particularly\nproblematic, because they direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web page, where everything from the web address to the security certificates\nappears correct. In reality, the link to the website is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to spot without specialist knowledge.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nSmurf Attack Occurs when mix-configured network device allow packet to be sent to all hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network\n\nTraffic analysis - is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even\nwhen the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more\ncan be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is a\nconcern in computer security.\n\nInterrupt attack- Interrupt attack occurs when a malicious action is performed by invoking the operating system to execute a particular system call.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 323\nOfficial ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd Edition Page number326\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming",

    },
    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nRetina based biometric involves analyzing the layer of blood vessels situated at the back of the eye. An established technology, this technique involves using a\nlow-intensity light source through an optical coupler to scan the unique patterns of the retina. Retinal scanning can be quite accurate but does require the user to\nlook into a receptacle and focus on a given point. This is not particularly convenient if you wear glasses or are concerned about having close contact with the\nreading device. For these reasons, retinal scanning is not warmly accepted by all users, even though the technology itself can work well.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nBiometrics\nBiometrics verifies an individual's identity by analyzing a unique personal attribute or behavior, which is one of the most effective and accurate methods of verifying\nidentification and not well received by society. Biometrics is a very sophisticated technology; thus, it is much more expensive and complex than the other types of\nidentity verification processes. A biometric system can make authentication decisions based on an individual's behavior, as in signature dynamics, but these can\nchange over time and possibly be forged. Biometric systems that base authentication decisions on physical attributes (such as iris, retina, or fingerprint) provide\nmore accuracy because physical attributes typically don't change, absent some disfiguring injury, and are harder to impersonate\n\fBiometrics is typically broken up into two different categories. The first is the physiological. These are traits that are physical attributes unique to a specific\nindividual. Fingerprints are a common example of a physiological trait used in biometric systems. The second category of biometrics is known as behavioral. The\nbehavioral authentication is also known as continuous authentication. The behavioral/continuous authentication prevents session hijacking attack. This is based on\na characteristic of an individual to confirm his identity. An example is signature Dynamics. Physiological is \"what you are\" and behavioral is \"what you do.\"\n\nWhen a biometric system rejects an authorized individual, it is called a Type I error (false rejection rate). When the system accepts impostors who should be\nrejected, it is called a Type II error (false acceptance rate). The goal is to obtain low numbers for each type of error, but Type II errors are the most dangerous and\nthus the most important to avoid.\nWhen comparing different biometric systems, many different variables are used, but one of the most important metrics is the crossover error rate (CER). This\nrating is stated as a percentage and represents the point at which the false rejection rate equals the false acceptance rate. This rating is the most important\nmeasurement when determining the system's accuracy. A biometric system that delivers a CER of 3 will be more accurate than a system that delivers a CER of 4.\nCrossover error rate (CER) is also called equal error rate (EER).\n\nThroughput describes the process of authenticating to a biometric system. This is also referred to as the biometric system response time. The primary\nconsideration that should be put into the purchasing and implementation of biometric access control are user acceptance, accuracy and processing speed.\n\nBiometric Considerations\nIn addition to the access control elements of a biometric system, there are several other considerations that are important to the integrity of the control\nenvironment. These are:\nResistance to counterfeiting\nData storage requirements\nUser acceptance\nReliability and\nTarget User and approach\n\nFingerprint\nFingerprints are made up of ridge endings and bifurcations exhibited by friction ridges and other detailed characteristics called minutiae. It is the distinctiveness of\nthese minutiae that gives each individual a unique fingerprint. An individual places his finger on a device that reads the details of the fingerprint and compares this\nto a reference file. If the two match, the individual's identity has been verified.\n\nPalm Scan\nThe palm holds a wealth of information and has many aspects that are used to identify an individual. The palm has creases, ridges, and grooves throughout that\nare unique to a specific person. The palm scan also includes the fingerprints of each finger. An individual places his hand on the biometric device, which scans\nand captures this information. This information is compared to a reference file, and the identity is either verified or rejected.\n\nHand Geometry\nThe shape of a person's hand (the shape, length, and width of the hand and fingers) defines hand geometry. This trait differs significantly between people and is\nused in some biometric systems to verify identity. A person places her hand on a device that has grooves for each finger. The system compares the geometry of\neach finger, and the hand as a whole, to the information in a reference file to verify that person's identity.\n\nRetina Scan\nA system that reads a person's retina scans the blood-vessel pattern of the retina on the backside of the eyeball. This pattern has shown to be extremely unique\nbetween different people. A camera is used to project a beam inside the eye and capture the pattern and compare it to a reference file recorded previously.\n\nIris Scan\nAn iris scan is a passive biometric control\nThe iris is the colored portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil. The iris has unique patterns, rifts, colors, rings, coronas, and furrows. The uniqueness of each of\nthese characteristics within the iris is captured by a camera and compared with the information gathered during the enrollment phase. When using an iris pattern\nbiometric system, the optical unit must be positioned so the sun does not shine into the aperture; thus, when implemented, it must have proper placement within\nthe facility.\n\nSignature Dynamics\nWhen a person signs a signature, usually they do so in the same manner and speed each time. Signing a signature produces electrical signals that can be\ncaptured by a biometric system. The physical motions performed when someone is signing a document create these electrical signals. The signals provide unique\ncharacteristics that can be used to distinguish one individual from another. Signature dynamics provides more information than a static signature, so there are\nmore variables to verify when confirming an individual's identity and more assurance that this person is who he claims to be.\n\nKeystroke Dynamics\nWhereas signature dynamics is a method that captures the electrical signals when a person signs a name, keystroke dynamics captures electrical signals when a\nperson types a certain phrase. As a person types a specified phrase, the biometric system captures the speed and motions of this action. Each individual has a\ncertain style and speed, which translate into unique signals. This type of authentication is more effective than typing in a password, because a password is easily\nobtainable. It is much harder to repeat a person's typing style than it is to acquire a password.\n\nVoice Print\nPeople's speech sounds and patterns have many subtle distinguishing differences. A biometric system that is programmed to capture a voice print and compare it\nto the information held in a reference file can differentiate one individual from another. During the enrollment process, an individual is asked to say several different\nwords.\n\nFacial Scan\nA system that scans a person's face takes many attributes and characteristics into account. People have different bone structures, nose ridges, eye widths,\nforehead sizes, and chin shapes. These are all captured during a facial scan and compared to an earlier captured scan held within a reference record. If the\ninformation is a match, the person is positively identified.\n\nHand Topography\nWhereas hand geometry looks at the size and width of an individual's hand and fingers, hand topology looks at the different peaks and valleys of the hand, along\nwith its overall shape and curvature. When an individual wants to be authenticated, she places her hand on the system. Off to one side of the system, a camera\nsnaps a side-view picture of the hand from a different view and angle than that of systems that target hand geometry, and thus captures different data. This\nattribute is not unique enough to authenticate individuals by itself and is commonly used in conjunction with hand geometry.\n\nVascular Scan\nVascular Scan uses the blood vessel under the first layer of skin.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nFingerprint - Fingerprints are made up of ridge endings and bifurcations exhibited by friction ridges and other detailed characteristics called minutiae. It is the\ndistinctiveness of these minutiae that gives each individual a unique fingerprint. An individual places his finger on a device that reads the details of the fingerprint\nand compares this to a reference file. If the two match, the individual's identity has been verified.\n\nHand Geometry - The shape of a person's hand (the shape, length, and width of the hand and fingers) defines hand geometry. This trait differs significantly\nbetween people and is used in some biometric systems to verify identity. A person places her hand on a device that has grooves for each finger. The system\ncompares the geometry of each finger, and the hand as a whole, to the information in a reference file to verify that person's identity.\n\nPalm Scan - The palm holds a wealth of information and has many aspects that are used to identify an individual. The palm has creases, ridges, and grooves\nthroughout that are unique to a specific person. The palm scan also includes the fingerprints of each finger. An individual places his hand on the biometric device,\nwhich scans and captures this information. This information is compared to a reference file, and the identity is either verified or rejected.\n\fCISA review manual 2014 Page number 330 and 331\nOfficial ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd Edition Page number 924",

While this wireless remote access is a significant benefit, it also creates a risk that unauthorized parties could also\nhave similar access to that information if proper controls are not in place. This risk is distinct from the business process risk because it can be realized even when\nbusiness processes are functioning as intended.\n\nA competitor or adversary can gain information from the RFID system in a number of ways, including eavesdropping on RF links between readers and tags,\nperforming independent queries on tags to obtain relevant data, and obtaining unauthorized access to a back-end database storing information about tagged\nitems. Supply chain applications may be particularly vulnerable to this risk because a variety of external entities may have read access to the tags or related\ndatabases.\n\nThe risk of unauthorized access is realized when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with that information. In some cases,\nthe information may trigger an immediate response. For example, someone might use a reader to determine whether a shipping container holds expensive\nelectronic equipment, and then break into the container when it gets a positive reading. This scenario is an example of targeting. In other cases, data might also be\naggregated over time to provide intelligence regarding an organization's operations, business strategy, or proprietary methods.\n\nFor instance, an organization could monitor the number of tags entering a facility to provide a reasonable indication of its business growth or operating practices.\nIn this case, if someone determined that a warehouse recently received a number of very large orders, then that might trigger an action in financial markets or\nprompt a competitor to change its prices or production schedule.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nRadio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically\nidentifying and tracking tags attached to objects.

This section reviews the major high-level business risks associated with RFID systems so that organizations planning or operating these systems\ncan better identify, characterize, and manage the risk in their environments.\n\nThe risks are as follows:\n\nBusiness Process Risk -Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the business processes the RFID system was designed to\nenable.\n\nBusiness Intelligence Risk- An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access to RFID- generated information and use it to harm the interests\nof the organization implementing the RFID system.\n\nPrivacy Risk - Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is considered personally identifiable information for a\npurpose other than originally intended or understood. The personal possession of functioning tags also is a privacy risk because it could enable tracking of those\nholding tagged items.\n\nExternality Risk -RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or collocated systems, assets, and people.\nAn important characteristic of RFID that impacts all of these risks is that RF communication is invisible to operators and users.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nBusiness Process Risk -Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the business processes the RFID system was designed to\nenable.\n\nExternality Risk -RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or collocated systems, assets, and people.\n\nPrivacy Risk - Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is considered personally identifiable information for a\npurpose other than originally intended or understood. The personal possession of functioning tags also is a privacy risk because it could enable tracking of those\nholding tagged items.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 248",

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nPhishing techniques include social engineering, link manipulation, spear phishing, whaling, dishing, or web site forgery techniques.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nPhishing is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money) by\nmasquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites, auction sites, banks, online\npayment\n\nprocessors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting public. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.\nPhishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost\nidentical to the legitimate one. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users, and exploits the poor usability of current web\nsecurity technologies. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical\nsecurity measures.\n\nSpear phishing\nPhishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. Attackers may gather personal information about their target to\nincrease their probability of success.\n\nLink manipulation\nMost methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear to belong to the\nspoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of sub domains are common tricks used by phishes. In the following example URL, http://\nwww.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL will take you to the example section of your bank website; actually this URL points to the \"your\nbank\" (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the tags) suggest a reliable\ndestination, when the link actually goes to the phishes' site. The following example link, //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuine, appears to direct the user to an article\nentitled \"Genuine\"; clicking on it will in fact take the user to the article entitled \"Deception\". In the lower left hand corner of most browsers users can preview and\nverify where the link is going to take them. Hovering your cursor over the link for a couple of seconds may do a similar thing, but this can still be set by the phishes\nthrough the HTML tooltip tag.\n\nWebsite forgery\nOnce a victim visits the phishing website, the deception is not over. Some phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to alter the address bar. This is done\neither by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.\n\nAn attacker can even use flaws in a trusted website's own scripts against the victim. These types of attacks (known as cross-site scripting) are particularly\nproblematic, because they direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web page, where everything from the web address to the security certificates\nappears correct. In reality, the link to the website is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to spot without specialist knowledge.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nSmurf Attack Occurs when mix-configured network device allow packet to be sent to all hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network\nTraffic analysis - is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even\nwhen the messages are encrypted and cannot be decrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more\ncan be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is a\nconcern in computer security.\n\nInterrupt attack- Interrupt attack occurs when a malicious action is performed by invoking the operating system to execute a particular system call.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 323\nOfficial ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd Edition Page number 493\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing",

In recent years, much press has been dedicated to\nthe privacy of information and the need to protect it from individuals, who may be able to commit crimes by viewing the information.\n\nIdentity theft is the act of assuming one's identity through knowledge of confidential information obtained from various sources.\nAn important measure to ensure confidentiality of information is data classification. This helps to determine who should have access to the information (public,\ninternal use only, or confidential). Identification, authentication, and authorization through access controls are practices that support maintaining the confidentiality\nof information.\n\nA sample control for protecting confidentiality is to encrypt information. Encryption of information limits the usability of the information in the event it is accessible to\n\fan unauthorized person.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nIntegrity\nIntegrity is the principle that information should be protected from intentional, unauthorized, or accidental changes.\n\nInformation stored in files, databases, systems, and networks must be relied upon to accurately process transactions and provide accurate information for\nbusiness decision making. Controls are put in place to ensure that information is modified through accepted practices.\n\nSample controls include management controls such as segregation of duties, approval checkpoints in the systems development life cycle, and implementation of\ntesting practices that assist in providing information integrity.

Loss of service due to a disaster, which could be man-made (e.g., poor capacity planning resulting in system crash, outdated hardware, and poor testing\nresulting in system crash after upgrade) or natural (e.g., earthquake, tornado, blackout, hurricane, fire, and flood).\n\nIn either case, the end user does not have access to information needed to conduct business. The criticality of the system to the user and its importance to the\nsurvival of the organization will determine how significant the impact of the extended downtime becomes.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nSoftware tools can provide object reuse assurance. These tools overwrite every sector of magnetic media with a random or predetermined bit pattern. Overwrite\nmethods are effective for all forms of electronic media with the exception of read-only optical media.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nWhen media is to be reassigned (a form of object reuse), it is important that all residual data is carefully removed. Simply deleting files or formatting media does\nnot actually remove the information. File deletion and media formatting often simply remove the pointers to the information. Providing assurance for object reuse\nrequires specialized tools and techniques according to the type of media on which the data resides. Specialized hardware devices known as degausses can be\nused to erase data saved to magnetic media. The measure of the amount of energy needed to reduce the magnetic field on the media to zero is known as\ncoercivity. It is important to make sure that the coercivity of the degasser is of sufficient strength to meet object reuse requirements when erasing data. If a\ndegasser is used with insufficient coercivity, then a remanence of the data will exist. Remanence is the measure of the existing magnetic field on the media; it is\nthe residue that remains after an object is degaussed or written over. Data is still recoverable even when the remanence is small. While data remanence exists,\nthere is no assurance of safe object reuse. Some degausses can destroy drives. The security professional should exercise caution when recommending or using\ndegausses on media for reuse.\n\fSoftware tools also exist that can provide object reuse assurance. These tools overwrite every sector of magnetic media with a random or predetermined bit\npattern. Overwrite methods are effective for all forms of electronic media with the exception of read-only optical media. There exists a drawback to using overwrite\nsoftware. During normal write operations with magnetic media, the head of the drive moves back-and-forth across the media as data is written. The track of the\nhead does not usually follow the exact path each time. The result is a miniscule amount of data remanence with each pass. With specialized equipment, it is\npossible to read data that has been overwritten. To provide higher assurance in this case, it is necessary to overwrite each sector multiple times. Security\npractitioners should keep in mind that a one-time pass may be acceptable for noncritical information, but sensitive data should be overwritten with multiple passes.\nOverwrite software can also be used to clear the sectors within solid-state media such as USB thumb drives. It is suggested that physical destruction methods\nsuch as incineration or secure recycling should be considered for solid-state media that is no longer used.\nThe last form of preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data is media destruction. Shredding, burning, grinding, and pulverizing are common methods of\nphysically destroying media. Degaussing can also be a form of media destruction. High-power degausses are so strong in some cases that they can literally bend\nand warp the platters in a hard drive. Shredding and burning are effective destruction methods for non-rigid magnetic media. Indeed, some shredders are capable\nof shredding some rigid media such as an optical disk. This may be an effective alternative for any optical media containing nonsensitive information due to the\nresidue size remaining after feeding the disk into the machine. However, the residue size might be too large for media containing sensitive information.\nAlternatively, grinding and pulverizing are acceptable choices for rigid and solid-state media. Specialized devices are available for grinding the face of optical\nmedia that either sufficiently scratches the surface to render the media unreadable or actually grinds off the data layer of the disk. Several services also exist\nwhich will collect drives, destroy them on site if requested and provide certification of completion. It will be the responsibility of the security professional to help,\nselect, and maintain the most appropriate solutions for media cleansing and disposal.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nDegaussing -Erasing data by applying magnetic field around magnetic media. Degausses device is used to erase the data. Sometime degausses can make\nmagnetic media unusable. So degaussing is not recommended way if magnetic media needs to be reused.\nFormat magnetic media Formatting magnetic media does not erase all data. Data can be recoverable after formatting using software tools.\nDelete File allocation table-It will not erase all data.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nThe Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Protocol is primarily used to provide confidentiality to the information sent across clients and servers.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a commonly-used protocol for managing the security of a message transmitted over a public network such as the Internet.\n\nSSL has recently been succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is based on SSL.SSL uses a program layer located between the Internet's Hypertext\nTransfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) layers.\n\nSSL is included as part of both the Microsoft and Netscape browsers and most Web server products.\n\fDeveloped by Netscape, SSL also gained the support of Microsoft and other Internet client/server developers as well and became the de facto standard until\nevolving into Transport Layer Security. The \"sockets\" part of the term refers to the sockets method of passing data back and forth between a client and a server\nprogram in a network or between program layers in the same computer.SSL uses the public-and-private key encryption system from RSA, which also includes the\nuse of a digital certificate. Later on SSL uses a Session Key along a Symmetric Cipher for the bulk of the data.\nTLS and SSL are an integral part of most Web browsers (clients) and Web servers. If a Web site is on a server that supports SSL, SSL can be enabled and\nspecific Web pages can be identified as requiring SSL access. Any Web server can be enabled by using Netscape's SSLRef program library which can be\ndownloaded for noncommercial use or licensed for commercial use.\n\nTLS and SSL are not interoperable. However, a message sent with TLS can be handled by a client that handles SSL but not TLS.\n\nThe SSL handshake\nA HTTP-based SSL connection is always initiated by the client using a URL starting with https:// instead of with http://. At the beginning of an SSL session, an SSL\nhandshake is performed. This handshake produces the cryptographic parameters of the session. A simplified overview of how the SSL handshake is processed is\nshown in the diagram below.\n\nSSL Handshake\n\n\n\n\nThe client sends a client \"hello\" message that lists the cryptographic capabilities of the client (sorted in client preference order), such as the version of SSL, the\ncipher suites supported by the client, and the data compression methods supported by the client. The message also contains a 28-byte random number.\n\nThe server responds with a server \"hello\" message that contains the cryptographic method (cipher suite) and the data compression method selected by the server,\nthe session ID, and another random number.\nNote:\nThe client and the server must support at least one common cipher suite, or else the handshake fails. The server generally chooses the strongest common cipher\nsuite.\n\nThe server sends its digital certificate. (In this example, the server uses X.509 V3 digital certificates with SSL.)\n\nIf the server uses SSL V3, and if the server application (for example, the Web server) requires a digital certificate for client authentication, the server sends a\n\"digital certificate request\" message. In the \"digital certificate request\" message, the server sends a list of the types of digital certificates supported and the\ndistinguished names of acceptable certificate authorities.\n\fThe server sends a server \"hello done\" message and waits for a client response. Upon receipt of the server \"hello done\" message, the client (the Web browser)\nverifies the validity of the server's digital certificate and checks that the server's \"hello\" parameters are acceptable.\n\nIf the server requested a client digital certificate, the client sends a digital certificate, or if no suitable digital certificate is available, the client sends a \"no digital\ncertificate\" alert. This alert is only a warning, but the server application can fail the session if client authentication is mandatory.\n\nThe client sends a \"client key exchange\" message. This message contains the pre-master secret, a 46-byte random number used in the generation of the\nsymmetric encryption keys and the message authentication code (MAC) keys, encrypted with the public key of the server.\n\nIf the client sent a digital certificate to the server, the client sends a \"digital certificate verify\" message signed with the client's private key. By verifying the signature\nof this message, the server can explicitly verify the ownership of the client digital certificate.\n\nNote:\nAn additional process to verify the server digital certificate is not necessary. If the server does not have the private key that belongs to the digital certificate, it\ncannot decrypt the pre-master secret and create the correct keys for the symmetric encryption algorithm, and the handshake fails.\n\nThe client uses a series of cryptographic operations to convert the pre-master secret into a master secret, from which all key material required for encryption and\nmessage authentication is derived. Then the client sends a \"change cipher spec\" message to make the server switch to the newly negotiated cipher suite. The\nnext message sent by the client (the \"finished\" message) is the first message encrypted with this cipher method and keys.\n\nThe server responds with a \"change cipher spec\" and a \"finished\" message of its own. The SSL handshake ends, and encrypted application data can be sent.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nFTP - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard Internet protocol for transmitting files between computers on the Internet. Like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n(HTTP), which transfers displayable Web pages and related files, and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which transfers e-mail, FTP is an application\nprotocol that uses the Internet's TCP/IP protocols. FTP is commonly used to transfer Web page files from their creator to the computer that acts as their server for\neveryone on the Internet. It's also commonly used to download programs and other files to your computer from other servers.\n\nSSH - Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other\nsecure network services between two networked computers. It connects, via a secure channel over an insecure network, a server and a client running SSH server\nand SSH client programs, respectively.\n\nS/MIME - S/MIME (Secure Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a secure method of sending e-mail that uses the Rivets-Shamir-Adelman encryption system.\nS/MIME is included in the latest versions of the Web browsers from Microsoft and Netscape and has also been endorsed by other vendors that make messaging\nproducts. RSA has proposed S/MIME as a standard to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 352\nOfficial ISC2 guide to CISSP CBK 3rd Edition Page number 256\nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/tividd/td/ITAME/SC32-1363-00/en_US/HTML/ss7aumst18.htm",

    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nPERMANENTLY is the keyword used in the question. You need to find out data removal method which remove data permanently from magnetic media.\n\nDegaussing is the most effective method out of all provided choices to erase sensitive data on magnetic media provided magnetic media is not requiring to be\nreuse. Some degausses can destroy drives. The security professional should exercise caution when recommending or using degausses on media for reuse.\n\nA device that performs degaussing generates a coercive magnetic force that reduces the magnetic flux density of the storage media to zero. This magnetic force is\nwhat properly erases data from media. Data are stored on magnetic media by the representation of the polarization of the atoms. Degaussing changes this\npolarization (magnetic alignment) by using a type of large magnet to bring it back to its original flux (magnetic alignment).\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nWhen media is to be reassigned (a form of object reuse), it is important that all residual data is carefully\n\nremoved.\n\nSimply deleting files or formatting the media does not actually remove the information. File deletion and media formatting often simply remove the pointers to the\ninformation. Providing assurance for object reuse requires specialized tools and techniques according to the type of media on which the data resides.\n\nSpecialized hardware devices known as degausses can be used to erase data saved to magnetic media. The measure of the amount of energy needed to reduce\nthe magnetic field on the media to zero is known as coercivity. It is important to make sure that the coercivity of the degasser is of sufficient strength to meet object\nreuse requirements when erasing data. If a degasser is used with insufficient coercivity, then a remanence of the data will exist.\n\nRemanence is the measure of the existing magnetic field on the media; it is the residue that remains after an object is degaussed or written over. Data is still\nrecoverable even when the remanence is small. While data remanence exists, there is no assurance of safe object reuse. Some degausses can destroy drives.\nThe security professional should exercise caution when recommending or using degausses on media for reuse.\n\nSoftware tools also exist that can provide object reuse assurance. These tools overwrite every sector of magnetic media with a random or predetermined bit\npattern. Overwrite methods are effective for all forms of electronic media with the exception of read-only optical media. There is a drawback to using overwrite\nsoftware. During normal write operations with magnetic media, the head of the drive moves back-and-forth across the media as data is written. The track of the\nhead does not usually follow the exact path each time. The result is a miniscule amount of data remanence with each pass. With specialized equipment, it is\npossible to read data that has been overwritten.\n\nTo provide higher assurance in this case, it is necessary to overwrite each sector multiple times. Security practitioners should keep in mind that a one-time pass\nmay be acceptable for noncritical information, but sensitive data should be overwritten with multiple passes. Overwrite software can also be used to clear the\nsectors within solid-state media such as USB thumb drives. It is suggested that physical destruction methods such as incineration or secure recycling should be\nconsidered for solid-state media that is no longer used.\n\nThe last form of preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data is media destruction. Shredding, burning, grinding, and pulverizing are common methods of\nphysically destroying media. Degaussing can also be a form of media destruction. High-power degausses are so strong in some cases that they can literally bend\nand warp the platters in a hard drive.\n\fShredding and burning are effective destruction methods for non-rigid magnetic media. Indeed, some shredders are capable of shredding some rigid media such\nas an optical disk. This may be an effective alternative for any optical media containing nonsensitive information due to the residue size remaining after feeding the\ndisk into the machine.\n\nHowever, the residue size might be too large for media containing sensitive information. Alternatively, grinding and pulverizing are acceptable choices for rigid and\nsolid-state media. Specialized devices are available for grinding the face of optical media that either sufficiently scratches the surface to render the media\nunreadable or actually grinds off the data layer of the disk. Several services also exist which will collect drives, destroy them on site if requested and provide\ncertification of completion. It will be the responsibility of the security professional to help, select, and maintain the most appropriate solutions for media cleansing\nand disposal.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nOverwrite every sector of magnetic media with pattern of 1's and 0's-Less effective than degaussing provided magnetic media is not requiring to be reuse.\nFormat magnetic media Formatting magnetic media does not erase all data. Data can be recoverable after formatting using software tools.\nDelete File allocation table-It will not erase all data.

It is one of the most common abuses, because it requires limited technical\nknowledge and occurs before computer security can protect the data. There are only compensating controls for data diddling. Piggybacking is the act of following\nan authorized person through a secured door and can be prevented by the use of deadman doors. Logical piggybacking is an attempt to gain access through\nsomeone who has the rights, e.g., electronically attaching to an authorized telecommunication link to possibly intercept transmissions. This could be prevented by\nencrypting the message. Viruses are malicious program code inserted into another executable code that can self-re plicate and spread from computer to computer\nvia sharing of computer diskettes, transfer of logic over telecommunication lines or direct contact with an infected machine. Antiviral software can be used to\nprotect the computer against viruses. The shutdown of an application can be initiated through terminals or microcomputers connected directly (online) or indirectly\n(dial-up line) to the computer. Only individuals knowing the high-level logon ID and password can initiate the shutdown process, which is effective if there are\nproper access controls.",

This test is performed regularly on\ndifferent aspects of the plan and can be a cost-effective way to gradually obtain evidence about the plan's effectiveness. It also provides a means to improve the\nplan in increments. A paper test is a walkthrough of the plan, involving major players, who attempt to determine what might happen in a particular type of service\ndisruption in the plan's execution. A paper test usually precedes the preparedness test. A post-test is actually a test phase and is comprised of a group of\nactivities, such as returning all resources to their proper place, disconnecting equipment, returning personnel and deleting all company data from third- party\nsystems. A walkthrough is a test involving a simulated disaster situation that tests the preparedness and understanding of management and staff, rather than the\nactual resources.",

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nChoice A specifically addresses the question of sensitive data by controlling what information users can access. Column-level security prevents users from seeing\none or more attributes on a table. With row-level security a certain grouping of information on a table is restricted; e.g., if a table held details of employee salaries,\nthen a restriction could be put in place to ensure that, unless specifically authorized, users could not view the salaries of executive staff. Column- and row-level\nsecurity can be achieved in a relational database by allowing users to access logical representations of data rather than physical tables. This 'fine-grained' security\nmodel is likely to offer the best balance between information protection while still supporting a wide range of analytical and reporting uses. Enhancing user\nauthentication via strong passwords is a security control that should apply to all users of the data warehouse and does not specifically address protection of\nsensitive data. Organizing a data warehouse into subject-specific databases is a potentially useful practice but, in itself, does not adequately protect sensitive data.\nDatabase-level security is normally too 'coarse' a level to efficiently and effectively protect information. For example, one database may hold information that needs\nto be restricted\n\nsuch as employee salary and customer profitability details while other information such as employee department may need to be legitimately a accessed by a\nlarge number of users. Organizing the data warehouse into subject matter-specific databases is similar to user access in that this control should generally apply.\nExtra attention could be devoted to reviewing access to tables with sensitive data, but this control is not sufficient without strong preventive controls at the column\nand row level. For choice D, logging user access is important, but it is only a detective control that will not provide adequate protection to sensitive information.",

      "D": "Security administrators"
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Governance and Management of IT\nThe security officer would be the best person to oversee the development of such policies.\n\nSecurity officers and their teams have typically been charged with the responsibility of creating the security policies. The policies must be written and\ncommunicated appropriately to ensure that they can be understood by the end users. Policies that are poorly written, or written at too high of an education level\n(common industry practice is to focus the content for general users at the sixth- to eighth-grade reading level), will not be understood.\n\nImplementing security policies and the items that support them shows due care by the company and its management staff. Informing employees of what is\nexpected of them and the consequences of noncompliance can come down to a liability issue.\n\nWhile security officers may be responsible for the development of the security policies, the effort should be collaborative to ensure that the business issues are\naddressed.\n\nThe security officers will get better corporate support by including other areas in policy development. This helps build buy-in by these areas as they take on a\ngreater ownership of the final product. Consider including areas such as HR, legal, compliance, various IT areas and specific business area representatives who\nrepresent critical business units.\n\nWhen policies are developed solely within the IT department and then distributed without business input, they are likely to miss important business considerations.\nOnce policy documents have been created, the basis for ensuring compliance is established. Depending on the organization, additional documentation may be\nnecessary to support policy. This support may come in the form of additional controls described in standards, baselines, or procedures to help personnel with\ncompliance. An important step after documentation is to make\n\nthe most current version of the documents readily accessible to those who are expected to follow them. Many organizations place the documents on their intranets\nor in shared file folders to facilitate their accessibility. Such placement of these documents plus checklists, forms, and sample documents can make awareness\nmore effective.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nEnd User - The end user is responsible for protecting information assets on a daily basis through adherence to the security policies that have been communicated.\n\nExecutive Management/Senior Management -Executive management maintains the overall responsibility for protection of the information assets. The business\noperations are dependent upon information being available, accurate, and protected from individuals without a need to know.\n\nSecurity Officer - The security officer directs, coordinates, plans, and organizes information security activities throughout the organization. The security officer\nworks with many different individuals, such as executive management, management of the business units, technical staff, business partners, auditors, and third\nparties such as vendors. The security officer and his or her team are responsible for the design, implementation, management, and review of the organization's\nsecurity policies, standards, procedures, baselines, and guidelines.\n\nInformation Systems Security Professional-Drafting of security policies, standards and supporting guidelines, procedures, and baselines is coordinated through\nthese individuals. Guidance is provided for technical security issues, and emerging threats are considered for the adoption of new policies. Activities such as\ninterpretation of government regulations and industry trends and analysis of vendor solutions to include in the security architecture that advances the security of\nthe organization are performed in this role.\n\nData/Information/Business/System Owners - A business executive or manager is typically responsible for an information asset. These are the individuals that\nassign the appropriate classification to information assets. They ensure that the business information is protected with appropriate controls. Periodically, the\ninformation asset owners need to review the classification and access rights associated with information assets. The owners, or their delegates, may be required\nto approve access to the information. Owners also need to determine the criticality, sensitivity, retention, backups, and safeguards for the information. Owners or\ntheir delegates are responsible for understanding the risks that exist with regards to the information that they control.\n\nData/Information Custodian/Steward - A data custodian is an individual or function that takes care of the information on behalf of the owner. These individuals\nensure that the information is available to the end users and is backed up to enable recovery in the event of data loss or corruption. Information may be stored in\nfiles, databases, or systems whose technical infrastructure must be managed, by systems administrators. This group administers access rights to the information\nassets.\n\nInformation Systems Auditor-IT auditors determine whether users, owners, custodians, systems, and networks are in compliance with the security policies,\nprocedures, standards, baselines, designs, architectures, management direction, and other requirements placed on systems. The auditors provide independent\nassurance to the management on the appropriateness of the security controls. The auditor examines the information systems and determines whether they are\ndesigned, configured, implemented, operated, and managed in a way ensuring that the organizational objectives are being achieved. The auditors provide top\ncompany management with an independent view of the controls and their effectiveness.\n\nBusiness Continuity Planner -Business continuity planners develop contingency plans to prepare for any occurrence that could have the ability to impact the\ncompany's objectives negatively. Threats may include earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, blackouts, changes in the economic/political climate, terrorist activities,\nfire, or other major actions potentially causing significant harm. The business continuity planner ensures that business processes can continue through the\ndisaster and coordinates those activities with the business areas and information technology personnel responsible for disaster recovery.\n\nInformation Systems/ Technology Professionals-These personnel are responsible for designing security controls into information systems, testing the controls, and\nimplementing the systems in production\n\nenvironments through agreed upon operating policies and procedures. The information systems professionals work with the business owners and the security\nprofessionals to ensure that the designed solution provides security controls commensurate with the acceptable criticality, sensitivity, and availability requirements\nof the application.\n\nSecurity Administrator - A security administrator manages the user access request process and ensures that privileges are provided to those individuals who have\nbeen authorized for access by application/system/data owners. This individual has elevated privileges and creates and deletes accounts and access permissions.\nThe security administrator also terminates access privileges when individuals leave their jobs or transfer between company divisions. The security administrator\nmaintains records of access request approvals and produces reports of access rights for the auditor during testing in an access controls audit to demonstrate\n\fcompliance with the policies.\n\nNetwork/Systems Administrator - A systems administrator (sysadmin/netadmin) configures network and server hardware and the operating systems to ensure that\nthe information can be available and accessible. The administrator maintains the computing infrastructure using tools and utilities such as patch management and\nsoftware distribution mechanisms to install updates and test patches on organization computers. The administrator tests and implements system upgrades to\nensure the continued reliability of the servers and network devices. The administrator provides vulnerability management through either commercial off the shelf\n(COTS) and/or non-COTS solutions to test the computing environment and mitigate vulnerabilities appropriately.\nPhysical Security - The individuals assigned to the physical security role establish relationships with external law enforcement, such as the local police agencies,\nstate police, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to assist in investigations. Physical security personnel manage the installation, maintenance, and ongoing\noperation of the closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance systems, burglar alarm systems, and card reader access control systems. Guards are placed where\nnecessary as a deterrent to unauthorized access and to provide safety for the company employees. Physical security personnel interface with systems security,\nhuman resources, facilities, and legal and business areas to ensure that the practices are integrated.\n\nSecurity Analyst - The security analyst role works at a higher, more strategic level than the previously described roles and helps develop policies, standards, and\nguidelines, as well as set various baselines. Whereas the previous roles are \"in the weeds\" and focus on pieces and parts of the security program, a security\nanalyst helps define the security program elements and follows through to ensure the elements are being carried out and practiced properly. This person works\nmore at a design level than at an implementation level.\n\nAdministrative Assistants/Secretaries - This role can be very important to information security; in many companies of smaller size, this may be the individual who\ngreets visitors, signs packages in and out, recognizes individuals who desire to enter the offices, and serves as the phone screener for executives. These\nindividuals may be subject to social engineering attacks, whereby the potential intruder attempts to solicit confidential information that may be used for a\nsubsequent attack. Social engineers prey on the goodwill of the helpful individual to gain entry. A properly trained assistant will minimize the risk of divulging useful\ncompany information or of providing unauthorized entry.\n\nHelp Desk Administrator - As the name implies, the help desk is there to field questions from users that report system problems. Problems may include poor\nresponse time, potential virus infections, unauthorized access, inability to access system resources, or questions on the use of a program. The help desk is also\noften where the first indications of security issues and incidents will be seen. A help desk individual would contact the computer security incident response team\n(CIRT) when a situation meets the criteria developed by the team. The help desk resets passwords, resynchronizes/reinitializes tokens and smart cards, and\nresolves other problems with access control.\n\nSupervisor - The supervisor role, also called user manager, is ultimately responsible for all user activity and any assets created and owned by these users. For\nexample, suppose Kathy is the supervisor of ten employees. Her responsibilities would include ensuring that these employees understand their responsibilities\nwith respect to security; making sure the employees' account information is up-to-date; and informing the security administrator when an employee is fired,\nsuspended, or transferred. Any change that pertains to an employee's role within the company usually affects what access rights they should and should not have,\nso the\n\nuser manager must inform the security administrator of these changes immediately.\n\nChange Control Analyst Since the only thing that is constant is change, someone must make sure changes happen securely. The change control analyst is\nresponsible for approving or rejecting requests to make changes to the network, systems, or software. This role must make certain that the change will not\nintroduce any vulnerabilities, that it has been properly tested, and that it is properly rolled out. The change control analyst needs to understand how various\nchanges can affect security, interoperability, performance, and productivity. Or, a company can choose to just roll out the change and see what happens.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nSystems Administrator - A systems administrator (sysadmin/ netadmin) configures network and server hardware and the operating systems to ensure that the\ninformation can be available and accessible. The administrator maintains the computing infrastructure using tools and utilities such as patch management and\nsoftware distribution mechanisms to install updates and test patches on organization computers. The administrator tests and implements system upgrades to\nensure the continued reliability of the servers and network devices.

    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Governance and Management of IT\nEven though Logical access to information by a terminated employee is possible if the ID and password of the terminated employee has not been deleted this is\nonly one part of the termination procedures. If user ID is not disabled or deleted, it could be possible for the employee without physical access to visit the\ncompany's networks remotely and gain access to the information.\n\nPlease note that this can also be seen in a different way: the most important thing to do could also be to inform others of the person's termination, because even if\nuser ID's and passwords are deleted, a terminated individual could simply socially engineer their way back in by calling an individual he/she used to work with and\nask them for access. He could intrude on the facility or use other weaknesses to gain access to information\n\nafter he has been terminated.\n\nBy notifying the appropriate company staff about the termination, they would in turn initiate account termination, ask the employee to return company property, and\nall credentials would be withdrawn for the individual concerned. This answer is more complete than simply disabling account.\n\nIt seems harsh and cold when this actually takes place, but too many companies have been hurt by vengeful employees who have lashed out at the company\nwhen their positions were revoked for one reason or another. If an employee is disgruntled in any way, or the termination is unfriendly, that employee's accounts\nshould be disabled right away, and all passwords on all systems changed.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below:\n\nEmployee Termination Processes\nEmployees join and leave organizations every day. The reasons vary widely, due to retirement, reduction in force, layoffs, termination with or without cause,\n\frelocation to another city, career opportunities with other employers, or involuntary transfers. Terminations may be friendly or unfriendly and will need different\nlevels of care as a result.\n\nFriendly Terminations\nRegular termination is when there is little or no evidence or reason to believe that the termination is not agreeable to both the company and the employee. A\nstandard set of procedures, typically maintained by the human resources department, governs the dismissal of the terminated employee to ensure that company\nproperty is returned, and all access is removed. These procedures may include exit interviews and return of keys, identification cards, badges, tokens, and\ncryptographic keys. Other property, such as laptops, cable locks, credit cards, and phone cards, are also collected. The user manager notifies the security\ndepartment of the termination to ensure that access is revoked for all platforms and facilities. Some facilities choose to immediately delete the accounts, while\nothers choose to disable the accounts for a policy defined period, for example, 30 days, to account for changes or extensions in the final termination date. The\ntermination process should include a conversation with the departing associate about their continued responsibility for confidentiality of information.\n\nUnfriendly Terminations\nUnfriendly terminations may occur when the individual is fired, involuntarily transferred, laid off, or when the organization has reason to believe that the individual\nhas the means and intention to potentially cause harm to the system. Individuals with technical skills and higher levels of access, such as the systems\nadministrators, computer programmers, database administrators, or any individual with elevated privileges, may present higher risk to the environment. These\nindividuals could alter files, plant logic bombs to create system file damage at a future date, or remove sensitive information. Other disgruntled users could enter\nerroneous data into the system that may not be discovered for several months. In these situations, immediate termination of systems access is warranted at the\ntime of termination or prior to notifying the employee of the termination. Managing the people aspect of security, from pre-employment to postemployment, is\ncritical to ensure that trustworthy, competent resources are employed to further the business objectives that will protect company information. Each of these\nactions contributes to preventive, detective, or corrective personnel controls.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe other options are less important.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 99\nHarris, Shun (2012-10-18).

This\ncloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.\nCloud computing service model\n\nCloud computing service models\n\fSoftware as a Service (Seas)\nSoftware as a Service (Seas) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers\nover a network, typically the Internet. SaaS is closely related to the ASP (application service provider) and on demand computing software delivery models. IDC\nidentifies two slightly different delivery models for Seas. The hosted application management (hosted AM) model is similar to ASP: a provider hosts commercially\navailable software for customers and delivers it over the Web. In the software on demand model, the provider gives customers network-based access to a single\ncopy of an application created specifically for Seas distribution.\n\nProvider gives users access to specific application software (CRM, e-mail, games). The provider gives the customers network based access to a single copy of an\napplication created specifically for Seas distribution\n\nand use.\n\nBenefits of the Seas model include:\n\neasier administration\nautomatic updates and patch management\ncompatibility: All users will have the same version of software.\neasier collaboration, for the same reason\nglobal accessibility.\n\nPlatform as a Service (Peas)\nPlatform as a Service (Peas) is a way to rent hardware, operating systems, storage and network capacity over the Internet. The service delivery model allows the\ncustomer to rent virtualized servers and associated services for running existing applications or developing and testing new ones.\n\nCloud providers deliver a computing platform, which can include an operating system, database, and web server as a holistic execution environment. Where Iasi is\nthe \"raw IT network,\" Peas is the software environment that runs on top of the IT network.\n\nPlatform as a Service (Peas) is an outgrowth of Software as a Service (Seas), a software distribution model in which hosted software applications are made\navailable to customers over the Internet. Peas has several advantages for developers. With Peas, operating system features can be changed and upgraded\nfrequently. Geographically distributed development teams can work together on software development projects. Services can be obtained from diverse sources\nthat cross international boundaries. Initial and ongoing costs can be reduced by the use of infrastructure services from a single vendor rather than maintaining\nmultiple hardware facilities that often perform duplicate functions or suffer from incompatibility problems. Overall expenses can also be minimized by unification of\nprogramming development efforts.\n\nOn the downside, Peas involves some risk of \"lock-in\" if offerings require proprietary service interfaces or development languages. Another potential pitfall is that\nthe flexibility of offerings may not meet the needs of some users whose requirements rapidly evolve.\n\nInfrastructure as a Service (Iasi)\nCloud providers offer the infrastructure environment of a traditional data center in an on-demand delivery method. Companies deploy their own operating systems,\napplications, and software onto this provided infrastructure and are responsible for maintaining them.\n\nInfrastructure as a Service is a provision model in which an organization outsources the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware,\nservers and networking components.

In the case of the CMM, for example, the basis for comparison would be the\norganizations' software development processes.\n\nStructure\n\nThe model involves five aspects:\n\nMaturity Levels: a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes would be systematically\nmanaged by a combination of process optimization and continuous process improvement.\n\nKey Process Areas: a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of goals considered important.\n\nGoals: the goals of a key process area summarize the states that must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an effective and lasting way.\nThe extent to which the goals have been accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization has established at that maturity level. The goals\nsignify the scope, boundaries, and intent of each key process area.\n\nCommon Features: common features include practices that implement and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of common features:\ncommitment to perform, ability to perform, activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying implementation.\n\nKey Practices: The key practices describe the elements of infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the implementation and institutionalization\nof the area.\n\nLevels\nThere are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and, according to the SEI: \"Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software\nprocesses are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief\".\n\nInitial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.\n\fRepeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that repeating the same steps may be attempted.\nDefined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business process, and decomposed to levels 0, 1 and 2 (the last being Work Instructions).\nManaged - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with agreed-upon metrics. Optimizing - process management includes deliberate process\noptimization/improvement.\n\nWithin each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which characteristic that level, and for each such area there are five factors: goals, commitment,\nability, measurement, and verification. These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing -- as they do -- the stages that organizations must go through on\nthe way to becoming mature.\n\nThe model provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next. Skipping levels is not\nallowed/feasible.\n\nLevel 1 - Initial (Chaotic)\nIt is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically) undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc,\nuncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes.\n\nLevel 2 - Repeatable\nIt is characteristic of processes at this level that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous, but\nwhere it exists it may help to ensure that existing processes are maintained during times of stress.\n\nLevel 3 - Defined\nIt is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of\nimprovement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance\nacross the organization.\n\nLevel 4 - Managed\nIt is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics, management can effectively control the AS-IS process (e.g., for software development). In\nparticular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from\nspecifications.\nProcess Capability is established from this level.\n\nLevel 5 - Optimizing\nIt is a characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological\nchanges/improvements.\n\nAt maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process (for example, to shift the\nmean of the process performance) to improve process performance. This would be done at the same time as maintaining the likelihood of achieving the\nestablished quantitative process-improvement objectives.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nThe other option specified in the option does not provide correct sequence.\nCISA review manual 2014 Page number 188\nCISSP Official study guide page number 693",

Those similar experiences cause certain responses, which become a\nset of expected and shared behaviors.

It is important to understand the culture of the enterprise because it profoundly influences what information is considered, how it is interpreted and what will\nbe done with it. Culture may exist on many levels, such as national (legislation/regulation, political and traditional), organizational (policies, hierarchical style and\nexpectations) and social (family, etiquette). It is created from both external and internal factors, and is influenced by and influences organizational patterns.\n\nFor your exam you should know the information below.\n\nBusiness Model for Information Security\nThe Business Model for Information Security (BMIS) originated at the Institute for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection at the Marshall School of Business\nat the University of Southern California in the USA. ISACA has undertaken the development of the Systemic Security Management Model. The BMIS takes a\nbusiness-oriented approach to managing information security, building on the foundational concepts developed by the Institute. The model utilizes systems\nthinking to clarify complex relationships within the enterprise, and thus to more effectively manage security. The elements and dynamic interconnections that form\nthe basis of the model establish the boundaries of an information security program and model how the program functions and reacts to internal and external\nchange. The BMIS provides the context for frameworks such as Cubit.\nThe essence of systems theory is that a system needs to be viewed holistically not merely as a sum of its parts to be accurately understood. A holistic approach\nexamines the system as a complete functioning unit. Another tenet of systems theory is that one part of the system enables understanding of other parts of the\nsystem. \"Systems thinking\" is a widely recognized term that refers to the examination of how systems interact, how complex systems work and why \"the whole is\nmore than the sum of its parts.\" Systems theory is most accurately described as a complex network of events, relationships, reactions, consequences,\ntechnologies, processes and people that interact in often unseen and unexpected ways. Studying the behaviors and results of the interactions can assist the\nmanager to better understand the organizational system and the way it functions. While management of any discipline within the enterprise can be enhanced by\napproaching it from a systems thinking perspective, its implementation will certainly help with managing risk.\n\nThe success that the systems approach has achieved in other fields bodes well for the benefits it can bring to security. The often dramatic failures of enterprises to\nadequately address security issues in recent years are due, to a significant extent, to their inability to define security and present it in a way that is comprehensible\nand relevant to all stakeholders. Utilizing a systems approach to information security management will help information security managers address complex and\ndynamic environments, and will generate a beneficial effect on collaboration within the enterprise, adaptation to operational change, navigation of strategic\nuncertainty and tolerance of the impact of external factors. The model is represented below.\n\fAs illustrated in above, the model is best viewed as a flexible, three-dimensional, pyramid-shaped structure made up of four elements linked together by six\ndynamic interconnections. All aspects of the model interact with each other. If any one part of the model is changed, not addressed or managed inappropriately,\nthe equilibrium of the model is potentially at risk. The dynamic interconnections act as tensions, exerting a push/pull force in reaction to changes in the enterprise,\nallowing the model to adapt as needed.\n\nThe four elements of the model are:\n\n1. Organization Design and Strategy An organization is a network of people, assets and processes interacting with each other in defined roles and working toward\na common goal. An enterprise's strategy specifies its business goals and the objectives to be achieved as well as the values and missions to be pursued. It is the\nenterprise's formula for success and sets its basic direction. The strategy should adapt to external and internal factors. Resources are the primary material to\ndesign the strategy and can be of different types (people, equipment, know-how). Design defines how the organization implements its strategy. Processes, culture\nand architecture are important in determining the design.\n\n2. People The human resources and the security issues that surround them. It defines who implements (through design) each part of the strategy. It represents a\nhuman collective and must take into account values, behaviors and biases. Internally, it is critical for the information security manager to work with the human\nresources and legal departments to address issues such as:\nRecruitment strategies (access, background checks, interviews, roles and responsibilities) Employment issues (location of office, access to tools and data, training\nand awareness, movement within the enterprise)\nTermination (reasons for leaving, timing of exit, roles and responsibilities, access to systems, access to other employees). Externally, customers, suppliers, media,\nstakeholders and others can have a strong influence on the enterprise and need to be considered within the security posture.\n\n3. Process Includes formal and informal mechanisms (large and small, simple and complex) to get things done and provides a vital link to all of the dynamic\ninterconnections. Processes identify, measure, manage and control risk, availability, integrity and confidentiality, and they also ensure accountability. They derive\nfrom the strategy and implement the operational part of the organization element.\nTo be advantageous to the enterprise, processes must:\nMeet business requirements and align with policy\nConsider emergence and be adaptable to changing requirements\nBe well documented and communicated to appropriate human resources Be reviewed periodically, once they are in place, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness\n\n4. Technology Composed of all of the tools, applications and infrastructure that make processes more efficient. As an evolving element that experiences frequent\nchanges, it has its own dynamic risk. Given the typical enterprise's dependence on technology, technology constitutes a core part of the enterprise's infrastructure\nand a critical component in accomplishing its mission. Technology is often seen by the enterprise's management team as a way to resolve security threats and\nrisk. While technical controls are helpful in mitigating some types of risk, technology should not be viewed as an information security solution.\nTechnology is greatly impacted by users and by organizational culture. Some individuals still mistrust technology; some have not learned to use it; and others feel\nit slows them down. Regardless of the reason, information security managers must be aware that many people will try to sidestep technical controls.\n\nDynamic Interconnections\n\nThe dynamic interconnections are what link the elements together and exert a multidirectional force that pushes and pulls as things change. Actions and behaviors\nthat occur in the dynamic interconnections can force the model out of balance or bring it back to equilibrium.\n\nThe six dynamic interconnections are:\n\n1. Governing Governing is the steering of the enterprise and demands strategic leadership. Governing sets limits within which an enterprise operates and is\nimplemented within processes to monitor performance, describe activities and achieve compliance while also providing adaptability to emergent conditions.\n\fGoverning incorporates ensuring that objectives are determined and defined, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately, and verifying that the enterprise's\nresources are used responsibly.\n2. Culture Culture is a pattern of behaviors, beliefs, assumptions, attitudes and ways of doing things. It is emergent and learned, and it creates a sense of comfort.\nCulture evolves as a type of shared history as a group goes through a set of common experiences. Those similar experiences cause certain responses, which\nbecome a set of expected and shared behaviors. These behaviors become unwritten rules, which become norms that are shared by all people who have that\ncommon history. It is important to understand the culture of the enterprise because it profoundly influences what information is considered, how it is interpreted\nand what will be done with it. Culture may exist on many levels, such as national (legislation/regulation, political and traditional), organizational (policies,\nhierarchical style and expectations) and social (family, etiquette). It is created from both external and internal factors, and is influenced by and influences\norganizational patterns.\n3. Enabling and support The enabling and support dynamic interconnection connects the technology element to the process element. One way to help ensure that\npeople comply with technical security measures, policies and procedures is to make processes usable and easy. Transparency can help generate acceptance for\nsecurity controls by assuring users that security will not inhibit their ability to work effectively. Many of the actions that affect both technology and processes occur\nin the enabling and support dynamic interconnection. Policies, standards and guidelines must be designed to support the needs of the business by reducing or\neliminating conflicts of interest, remaining flexible to support changing business objectives, and being acceptable and easy for people to follow.\n4. Emergence Emergence which connotes surfacing, developing, growing and evolving refers to patterns that arise in the life of the enterprise that appear to\nhave no obvious cause and whose outcomes seem impossible to predict and control. The emergence dynamic interconnection (between people and processes) is\na place to introduce possible solutions such as feedback loops; alignment with process improvement; and consideration of emergent issues in system design life\ncycle, change control, and risk management.\n5. Human factors The human factors dynamic interconnection represents the interaction and gap between technology and people and, as such, is critical to an\ninformation security program. If people do not understand how to use the technology, do not embrace the technology or will not follow pertinent policies, serious\nsecurity problems can evolve. Internal threats such as data leakage, data theft and misuse of data can occur within this dynamic interconnection. Human factors\nmay arise because of age, experience level and/or cultural experiences. Because human factors are critical components in maintaining balance within the model, it\nis important to train all of the enterprise's human resources on pertinent skills.\n6. Architecture A security architecture is a comprehensive and formal encapsulation of the people, processes, policies and technology that comprise an\nenterprise's security practices. A robust business information architecture is essential to understanding the need for security and designing the security\narchitecture. It is within the architecture dynamic interconnection that the enterprise can ensure defense in depth. The design describes how the security controls\nare positioned and how they relate to the overall IT architecture. An enterprise security architecture facilitates security capabilities across lines of businesses in a\nconsistent and a cost-effective manner and enables enterprises to be proactive with their security investment decisions.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nGoverning - Governing is the steering of the enterprise and demands strategic leadership. Governing sets limits within which an enterprise operates and is\nimplemented within processes to monitor performance, describe activities and achieve compliance while also providing adaptability to emergent conditions.\nGoverning incorporates ensuring that objectives are determined and defined, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately, and verifying that the enterprise's\nresources are used responsibly.\n\nEnabling and support - The enabling and support dynamic interconnection connects the technology element to the process element.

Studying the behaviors and results of the interactions can assist the\nmanager to better understand the organizational system and the way it functions. While management of any discipline within the enterprise can be enhanced by\napproaching it from a systems thinking perspective, its implementation will certainly help with managing risk.\n\nThe success that the systems approach has achieved in other fields bodes well for the benefits it can bring to security. The often dramatic failures of enterprises to\nadequately address security issues in recent years are due, to a significant extent, to their inability to define security and present it in a way that is comprehensible\nand relevant to all stakeholders. Utilizing a systems approach to information security management will help information security managers address complex and\ndynamic environments, and will generate a beneficial effect on collaboration within the enterprise, adaptation to operational change, navigation of strategic\nuncertainty and tolerance of the impact of external factors. The model is represented below.\n\fAs illustrated in above, the model is best viewed as a flexible, three-dimensional, pyramid-shaped structure made up of four elements linked together by six\ndynamic interconnections.\n\nAll aspects of the model interact with each other. If any one part of the model is changed, not addressed or managed inappropriately, the equilibrium of the model\nis potentially at risk. The dynamic interconnections act as tensions, exerting a push/pull force in reaction to changes in the enterprise, allowing the model to adapt\nas needed.\n\nThe four elements of the model are:\n\n1. Organization Design and Strategy organization is a network of people, assets and processes interacting with each other in defined roles and working toward a\ncommon goal.\n\nAn enterprise's strategy specifies its business goals and the objectives to be achieved as well as the values and missions to be pursued. It is the enterprise's\nformula for success and sets its basic direction. The strategy should adapt to external and internal factors. Resources are the primary material to design the\nstrategy and can be of different types (people, equipment, know-how). Design defines how the organization implements its strategy. Processes, culture and\narchitecture are important in determining the design.\n\n2. People The human resources and the security issues that surround them. It defines who implements (through design) each part of the strategy. It represents a\nhuman collective and must take into account values, behaviors and biases. Internally, it is critical for the information security manager to work with the human\nresources and legal departments to address issues such as:\nRecruitment strategies (access, background checks, interviews, roles and responsibilities) Employment issues (location of office, access to tools and data, training\nand awareness, movement within the enterprise)\nTermination (reasons for leaving, timing of exit, roles and responsibilities, access to systems, access to other employees). Externally, customers, suppliers, media,\nstakeholders and others can have a strong influence on the enterprise and need to be considered within the security posture.\n\n3. Process Includes formal and informal mechanisms (large and small, simple and complex) to get things done and provides a vital link to all of the dynamic\ninterconnections. Processes identify, measure, manage and control risk, availability, integrity and confidentiality, and they also ensure accountability. They derive\nfrom the strategy and implement the operational part of the organization element.\nTo be advantageous to the enterprise, processes must:\nMeet business requirements and align with policy\nConsider emergence and be adaptable to changing requirements\nBe well documented and communicated to appropriate human resources Be reviewed periodically, once they are in place, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness\n\n4. Technology Composed of all of the tools, applications and infrastructure that make processes more efficient. As an evolving element that experiences frequent\nchanges, it has its own dynamic risk. Given the typical enterprise's dependence on technology, technology constitutes a core part of the enterprise's infrastructure\nand a critical component in accomplishing its mission. Technology is often seen by the enterprise's management team as a way to resolve security threats and\nrisk. While technical controls are helpful in mitigating some types of risk, technology should not be viewed as an information security solution.\nTechnology is greatly impacted by users and by organizational culture. Some individuals still mistrust technology; some have not learned to use it; and others feel\nit slows them down. Regardless of the reason, information security managers must be aware that many people will try to sidestep technical controls.\n\nDynamic Interconnections\nThe dynamic interconnections are what link the elements together and exert a multidirectional force that pushes and pulls as things change. Actions and behaviors\nthat occur in the dynamic interconnections can force the model out of balance or bring it back to equilibrium.\n\fThe six dynamic interconnections are:\n\n1. Governing Governing is the steering of the enterprise and demands strategic leadership. Governing sets limits within which an enterprise operates and is\nimplemented within processes to monitor performance, describe activities and achieve compliance while also providing adaptability to emergent conditions.\nGoverning incorporates ensuring that objectives are determined and defined, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately, and verifying that the enterprise's\nresources are used responsibly.\n\n2. Culture Culture is a pattern of behaviors, beliefs, assumptions, attitudes and ways of doing things. It is emergent and learned, and it creates a sense of comfort.\nCulture evolves as a type of shared history as a group goes through a set of common experiences. Those similar experiences cause certain responses, which\nbecome a set of expected and shared behaviors. These behaviors become unwritten rules, which become norms that are shared by all people who have that\ncommon history. It is important to understand the culture of the enterprise because it profoundly influences what information is considered, how it is interpreted\nand what will be done with it. Culture may exist on many levels, such as national (legislation/regulation, political and\n\ntraditional), organizational (policies, hierarchical style and expectations) and social (family, etiquette). It is created from both external and internal factors, and is\ninfluenced by and influences organizational patterns.\n\n3. Enabling and support The enabling and support dynamic interconnection connects the technology element to the process element. One way to help ensure that\npeople comply with technical security measures, policies and procedures is to make processes usable and easy. Transparency can help generate acceptance for\nsecurity controls by assuring users that security will not inhibit their ability to work effectively. Many of the actions that affect both technology and processes occur\nin the enabling and support dynamic interconnection. Policies, standards and guidelines must be designed to support the needs of the business by reducing or\neliminating conflicts of interest, remaining flexible to support changing business objectives, and being acceptable and easy for people to follow.\n\n4. Emergence Emergence which connotes surfacing, developing, growing and evolving refers to patterns that arise in the life of the enterprise that appear to\nhave no obvious cause and whose outcomes seem impossible to predict and control. The emergence dynamic interconnection (between people and processes) is\na place to introduce possible solutions such as feedback loops; alignment with process improvement; and consideration of emergent issues in system design life\ncycle, change control, and risk management.\n\n5. Human factors The human factors dynamic interconnection represents the interaction and gap between technology and people and, as such, is critical to an\ninformation security program. If people do not understand how to use the technology, do not embrace the technology or will not follow pertinent policies, serious\nsecurity problems can evolve. Internal threats such as data leakage, data theft and misuse of data can occur within this dynamic interconnection. Human factors\nmay arise because of age, experience level and/or cultural experiences. Because human factors are critical components in maintaining balance within the model, it\nis important to train all of the enterprise's human resources on pertinent skills.\n\n6. Architecture A security architecture is a comprehensive and formal encapsulation of the people, processes, policies and technology that comprise an\nenterprise's security practices. A robust business information architecture is essential to understanding the need for security and designing the security\narchitecture. It is within the architecture dynamic interconnection that the enterprise can ensure defense in depth. The design describes how the security controls\nare positioned and how they relate to the overall IT architecture. An enterprise security architecture facilitates security capabilities across lines of businesses in a\nconsistent and a cost-effective manner and enables enterprises to be proactive with their security investment decisions.\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\nGoverning - Governing is the steering of the enterprise and demands strategic leadership. Governing sets limits within which an enterprise operates and is\nimplemented within processes to monitor performance, describe activities and achieve compliance while also providing adaptability to emergent conditions.\nGoverning incorporates ensuring that objectives are determined and defined, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately, and verifying that the enterprise's\nresources are used responsibly.\n\nEnabling and support - The enabling and support dynamic interconnection connects the technology element to the process element. One way to help ensure that\npeople comply with technical security measures, policies and procedures is to make processes usable and easy.

The receiver performs the same process and then compares the received hash, once it has been decrypted with their private key, to\nthe hash that is calculated with the received data. If they are the same, the conclusion would be that there is integrity in the data that have arrived and the origin is\nauthenticated. The concept of encrypting the hash with the private key of the originator provides non repudiation, as it can only be decrypted with their public key\nand, as the CD suggests, the private key would not be known to the recipient. Simply put, in a key-pair situation, anything that can be decrypted by a sender's\npublic key must have been encrypted with their private key, so they must have been the sender, i.e., non-repudiation. Choice C is incorrect because, if this were\nthe case, the hash could not be decrypted by the recipient, so the benefit of non-repudiation would be lost and there could be no verification that the message had\nnot been intercepted and amended. A digital signature is created by encrypting with a private key. A person creating the signature uses their own private key,\notherwise everyone would be able to create a signature with any public key. Therefore, the signature of the client is created with the client's private key, and this\ncan be verified--by the enterprise--using the client's public key. Choice B is the correct answer because, in this case, the customer uses their private key to sign\nthe hash data.",

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation/Reference:\nSection: Protection of Information Assets\nAn application-level gateway is the best way to protect against hacking because it can define with detail rules that describe the type of user or connection that is or\nis not permitted, it analyzes in detail each package, not only in layers one through four of the OSI model but also layers five through seven, which means that it\nreviews the commands of each higher-level protocol (HTTP, FTP, SNMP, etc.). For a remote access server, there is a device (server) that asks for a username\nand password before entering the network. This is good when accessing private networks, but it can be mapped or scanned from the Internet creating security\nexposure. Proxy servers can provide protection based on the IP address and ports. However, an individual is needed who really knows how to do this, and\napplications can use different ports for the different sections of the program. Port scanning works when there is a very specific task to complete, but not when\ntrying to control what comes from the Internet, or when all the ports available need to be controlled. For example, the port for Ping (echo request) could be blocked\nand the IP addresses would be available for the application and browsing, but would not respond to Ping.",

PKl meets these tests. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is the most common private key cryptographic system.\nDES does not address nonrepudiation. A MAC is a cryptographic value calculated by passing an entire message through a cipher system. The sender attaches\nthe MAC before transmission and the receiver recalculates the MAC and compares it to the sent MAC. If the two MACs are not equal, this indicates that the\nmessage has been altered during transmission; it has nothing to do with nonrepudiation.

Without any filters directly applied on mail gateway servers to block traffic without strong signatures, the workload will not\nincrease.

The number of rejected calls is a measure\nof how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include noise, echo and so on.\n\nATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service (QoS), data throughput, connect time,\nstability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.\n\nThere are many different ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled\ninstead of measured; one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. These diagrams allow the\nnetwork planner to analyze how the network will perform in each state, ensuring that the network will be optimally designed.\n\nThe following measures are often considered important:\n\nBandwidth - Bandwidth is commonly measured in bits/second is the maximum rate that information can be transferred\nThroughput - Throughput is the actual rate that information is transferred Latency - Latency is the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it, this is\nmainly a function of the signals travel time, and processing time at any nodes the information traverses Jitter - Jitter is the variation in the time of arrival at the\nreceiver of the information Error Rate - Error rate is the number of corrupted bits expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total sent\n\nThe following answers are incorrect:\n\nThe other options correctly describe network performance parameters.\nCISA review manual 2014 page number 275",

NDMP services interact with each other. The result of this interaction is the establishment of an NDMP control session if the session is being used to\nachieve control for the backup or restore operation. It would result in an NDMP data session if the session is being used to transfer actual file system or volume\ndata (including metadata). Control sessions are always TCP/IP-based, but data streams can be TCP/lP-or SAN- based. NDMP is more or less NAS-centric and\ndefines a way to back up and restore data from a device, such as a NAS appliance, on which it is difficult to install a backup software agent, in the absence of\nNDMP, this data must be backed up as a shared drive on the LAN, which is accessed via network file protocols, such as Common Internet File System (CIFS) or\nNetwork File System (NFS), degrading backup performance. NDMP works on a block level for transferring payload data (file content) but metadata and traditional\nfile system information needs to be handled by legacy backup systems that initiate NDMP data movement. NDMP does not know about nor takes care of\nconsistency issues regarding related volumes (e.g., a volume to store database files, a volume to store application server data and a volume to store web server\ndata). NDMP can be used to do backups in such an environment (e.g., SAP) but the logic required either must be put into a dedicated piece of software or must be\nscripted into the legacy backup software.",

Backups to disks are not dramatically faster than backups to tapes in a balanced\n\fenvironment. Most often than not there is hardly a difference, since the limiting components are not tape or disk drives but the overall sustained bandwidth of the\nbackup server's backplane. The advantage in terms of speed is in restoring performance, since all data are on hand and can be accessed randomly, resulting in a\ndramatic enhancement in throughput. This makes fast synthetic backups (making a full back up without touching the host's data only by using the existing\nincremental backups) efficient and easy. Although the cost of disks has been reduced, tape-based backup can offer an overall cost advantage over disk-only\nsolutions. Even if RAID arrays are used for D2Dstorage, a failed drive must be swapped out and the RAID set rebuilt before another disk drive fails, thus making\nthis kind of backup more risky and not suitable as a solution of last resort. In contrast, a single tape drive failure does not produce any data loss since the data\nresides on the tape media. In a multidrive library, the loss of the use of a single tape drive has no impact on the overall level of data protection. Conversely, the\nloss of a disk drive in an array can put all data at risk. This in itself reinforces the benefits of a disk-to-disk-to-any storage hierarchy, as data could be protected by\na tertiary stage of disk storage and ultimately tape. Beyond the drive failure issue, tape has an inherent reliability advantage over any disk drive as it has no boot\nsector or file allocation table that can be infected or manipulated by a virus.",
